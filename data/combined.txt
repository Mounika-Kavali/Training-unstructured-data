Managing Favorites 3 (May 2008) Managing Your Favorites 
 
Adding Favorites  
 
One of the more productive ways of working with in SAP is to use the Favorites procedure.  
Generally a user processes the same T-codes over and over.  SAP has a built-in method of 
gathering all of these procedures  into one area labeled Favorites.  This allows the user to find 
their T-code easily without looking fo r it in the menus or memorizing it. 
 There are different methods on adding favorites to the user ID.  The user can choose which 
method they feel comfortable using.  1) Insert Transaction 
 On the main menu in SAP click on Favorites>Insert Transaction

        Continue with this process to add more T-codes.  For Accounts Payable technicians, th e following T-codes are recommended: 
 F-43  Enter Vendor Invoice 
F-41  Enter Vendor Credit Memo 
FB08  Reverse Document MB01  Enter Goods Receipt (par t of 3 Way Match Process) 
MB03  Display Goods Receipt MIRO  Enter Vendor Invoice (p art of 3 Way Match Process)

Enter the 
T-code  
Click the green check mark

Managing Favorites 5 (May 2008) 2) Drag and Drop 
 
If the user finds a T-code in a menu, it can be added by dragging a nd dropping it under the 
Favorites folder.    
   
 
      
 
             
 
               
Highlight the T-code and then click 
and hold the left mouse button.

mouse button.  Then click ‘Add to favorites’. 
   
 
      
 
             
Once the favorites have been added, the user will  be able to access th e T-codes easily.  The 
favorites can be saved as a raw list  like below, or folders can be added to organize the favorites.

user can carry out their share of the business and communication processes in the enterprise.  It is 
here where the user is able to  create, edit and send and receiv e messages and documents.  This 
process is enabled from entire ly within the SAP environment without the necessity of going 
outside the system.  This part of The Business Workplace  is called SAP Mail and is, in fact, an 
internal e-mail system. 
 
The Business Workplace has six working environments for proce ssing documents and messages.  
The working environments are as foll ows and are flagged with symbols. 
 
 Working Environment  Description

Accounts Payable Overview 25 (May 2008) Accounts Payable Overview 
 
The Accounts Payable department is responsible for entering invoices received from vendors and 
then paying those vendors.  In SAP, there are two methods for en tering invoices and two 
methods for paying vendors. 
 First, there are direct invoices.  This method is used for invoice s such as BPA purchases, credit 
card invoices, petty cash and change fund re imbursements, employee travel expenses. 
 The other method is called the Three Way Match method.  It starts in Procurement with a 
purchase order being created.  Next, a goods receip t is posted once the goods are received.  The 
final step is the invoice verifica tion (also called MIRO in SAP). 
 Vendors are paid by two different me thods in SAP.  The first is by check.  This process is done 
at the individual regions.  The ot her method is by electronic fund tran sfer (EFT).  This process is 
done centrally by CNIC Millington w ith the approval of the regions.

replenishments (i.e., petty cash, change funds, un it funds), prize winnings (e.g., bingo events), or

(May 2008) 66 Reversal of Individual Documents Reversal of Individual Documents 
 
Documents that have been posted in error or contain amounts, accounts or  account assignments 
(cost centers, internal orders) that are in correct can easily be re versed.  SAP provides 
functionality to automatically generate a reversal  document when the user specifies the original 
document. 
 Remember that reversal documents 
cannot  be posted to a period that is already closed and the 
financial statements have already been generated.  Generally, SAP will use the posting date of 
the original document as the reversal posting date if it is within the current period.  A different 
posting date may be specified by the user.  It should be in the same accounting period as the 
original document.  If it is determined that an in voice from a previous (clo sed) period needs to be 
reversed, you must specify an alternate posti ng date because the system cannot post to the 
original.

Field Description/Usage 
Reverse Document:  Header Data 
Document no. Enter the document number to be reversed. 
Company code Enter the company code for the base /region in which the document to be 
reversed was originally posted. 
Fiscal year Enter the fiscal year in which the docu ment was originally posted.  Remember 
that F&FR uses document numbers t hat are company code dependant and that 
reset themselves after they reach the end of the respective number ranges.  
Therefore a unique document can only be found when the document 
number, company code and fiscal year are specified in combination.  This 
combination is a unique key in the database that identifies a particular document.  
Reverse posting details 
Reversal reason Currently, there are three reversal reason  codes that can be used.  This code is 
only used for reporting purposes (i.e. document reports can be executed with 
reversal reason code as a selection criteria).  The valid reason codes are: 
01 Reversal in current period 
02 Reversal in closed period (alt posting date) 
03 Accrual reversal 
 
Reason code # 03 should only be used for self-reversing journals (AJVs).  
Reason code # 01 should be used when the original document to be reversed was posted in the current period.  Reas on code # 02 should be used when the 
original document to be reversed was posted in a closed period. 
Posting date This field could be left blank if the posting date for the reversed document is 
similar to that of the original document.  This field must be filled when using 
reversal reason code # 02 - you must indicate the date you want the reversal 
posted (it CANNOT be in a closed period…it must be a date in the current 
period you are using).  This field should be left blank when using reversal reason code # 01. 
Posting period Leave this field blank unless the reversal document is to be posted into special 
period 13. 
Check management specifications 
Void reason code Leave blank. Do not use this transa ction to reverse check payments.

To reverse the document, click on the Save icon. 
 
Document number range is 1900000000 to 1999999999.  Write the reversing document number on

(May 2008) 68 Three Way Match Overview Three-way Match Overview 
 
Procuring items on a SAP purchase or der is part of the three-way match process.  In order for a 
purchase order to be paid, three things must occur: 
 
Step 1: 
 
The Procurement Technician must create the purchas e order in SAP.  In this step there is no 
accounting impact, although PO items are coded to  the appropriate general ledger account and 
cost center, or asset.  For more informa tion, please see the Procurement Beginner manual. 
 
Step 2: 
 The Accounts Payable Clerk/Receiving Agent must ente r a goods receipt (GR) into SAP.  In this 
step, the goods receipt will match up the informati on that was entered on the purchase order.  If 
this is a partial shipment, the clerk may modify  the quantity, which will leave the GR open until 
the rest of the shipment is entered.  The Ge neral Ledger is automatically updated with the 
general ledger account (i.e. expens e or prepaid account), cost cent er, or asset that was coded on 
the SAP Purchase Order.  The offsetting posting is  made to an account called the Goods Receipt/ 
Invoice Receipt (GR/IR) clearing account (201010).  This is k nown as an accrued liability 
account.  If a freight charge was included on th e PO, it will be posted to the Freight clearing 
account (201012), also an accrued liability account. 
 
 Credit  GR/IR 201010 
 Debit  Expense Account [(701000 (S upplies), 151000 (Inventory), 1710000012 
(Asset) Vehicle] 
 
Step 3: 
 
The Accounts Payable Clerk receives  the invoice.  Invoice Verifica tion is the last step of the 
three-way match process.  Transaction code MIRO  is used to enter the purchase order number 
and verify that the amount of the PO that app ears on the screen is the amount being invoiced.  
MIRO must match what was entered at the purcha se order level and goods receipt.  You are only 
authorized within AIMS/SAP to accept a +/- 3% variance between the purchase order line item

Three Way Match Overview 69 (May 2008) Goods Receipt 
 
The goods receipt should be verified against th e corresponding purchase order to ensure the 
correct goods and quantity are received. 
 
For all system generated purchase orders, the Ac counts Payable Technician  will directly enter 
the goods receipt into the system.  Based on local  connectivity and staffing requirements, it is 
possible for persons other than th e Accounting staff to enter the goods receipt into the system.  
The Receiving Agent (or warehouse person) may be  given authorization to enter the goods 
receipt in the AIMS system - this is a local decision. 
 
F&FR: 
 
Until such time that the wareh ouse and facility st affs have access to AIMS  and the goods receipt 
function, the following pr ocedure should be used: 
 
Purchasing/Receiving Agent 
 
1. Upon receipt of all goods, the goods receipt c opy of the purchase order is signed/dated by 
the receiving agent and forwarded to the Accounting Office. 
 
2. In cases of partial recei pts, the receiving copy should be flagged as “ partial ” and forwarded 
to the Accounting Office.  When  all goods are receiv ed, a final goods receipt can be signed 
and forwarded to the accounting office with a notation of “ complete ” or “ complete  
delivery ”. 
 
Accounting Office 
 
3. Goods Receipt is checked to ensure the Goods Receipt has been signed and dated. 
 
4. Goods Receipts are entere d into the SAP system. 
 
5. Goods Receipts document num ber should be noted on the Purchase order copy.

Sometimes a vendor does not ship all of the goods ordered on a purchase order.  However, the 
goods that do arrive need to be receipted in SAP.  This can be done by a partial receipt.  This is 
the reason that it is VERY IMPORTANT to lis t everything ordered on the PO.  Do NOT enter 
one line item as “See Attached” and one LOT (or EACH, CASE, etc).  You will not be able to 
process a partial receipt.

(May 2008) 106 Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  Invoices where prices vary from that of PO price 
 
If your invoices show a price difference from th at of the PO line item, your invoice will not 
“balance” and you will see the following notat ion when trying to save the invoice. 
 
  
 
     You must resolve these discrepanc ies prior to posting the document.  A price difference requires 
a purchase order modification (t his necessitates a return to the Procurement Department) IF it is 
more than the 3% (+/- $25) variance (see the beginning of the 3 Way Ma tch section for more 
details).  If there has been a Goods Receipt posted, this must be re versed (please see the 
“Goods 
Return”  section of this book).  If there is  a price difference you will get a hard ERROR  and you 
will NOT be able to save/post the invoice.

Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  107 (May 2008) Unplanned Delivery Costs (Freight) 
 
Usually vendors will add freight or a handling f ee when shipping goods.  If the amount is known 
at the time of the purchase order, it is best to include it on the PO.  For help with this, please see 
the Procurement Beginner manual.   
 Sometimes, the amount of freight is not known until the invoice arrives.  If this is the case, do 
NOT include it on the PO.  There is an area on th e MIRO to include unplanned delivery costs. 
      
 
             
 
  
 
On the Details tab of the MIRO, there is a fiel d called “Unpl. Del. Csts”.  You can enter the 
amount of freight listed on the invo ice.  SAP will add this amount to  the total of the PO.  This 
should then equal the amount of the invoice.  This  will not post to the Freight Clearing account 
(201012), but directly to the Expense accounts an d cost centers on the PO (proportioned out). 
 
 NOTE : This is only for delivery costs that were NOT  included on the purchase order.

(May 2008) 108 Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  Planned Freight Billed in Separate Invoice 
 
Sometimes vendors send separate invoices for th e goods ordered and the planned freight.  Both 
invoices are processed using MIRO a nd can be done at different times. 
 
When posting the first invoice for the goods ONLY:  
 
      
 
             
Enter the invoice info on the Basic data tab as usual.  The amount should be the PO total minus 
the amount for freight.  After entering the PO number, change the “G oods/service items + 
planned delivery costs” to just “Goods/service ite ms”.  This will exclude the line item for freight 
from the PO.  Then, press [Enter]  key or

(May 2008) 112 Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  Planned Freight Billed by Third Party Vendor 
 
Sometimes vendors will use a third party to ship goods.  The freight  charges are included on the 
PO, but the freight invoice will come from another vendor.   
 Process the MIRO for the goods as detailed above (P lanned Freight Billed in Separate Invoice).   
 
 
      
 
             
 
When the invoice for the freight arrives, pro cess it by changing the “Goods/service items + 
planned delivery costs” to “Planned delivery costs”.

Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  115 (May 2008) Credit Memo after MIRO invoice 
 
Sometimes goods need to be returned  after the invoice is posted.  In order to tie it to the original 
invoice, a credit memo can be entered through the MIRO function.  DO NOT use the credit 
memo t-code (F-41) as this will not give you the history with the PO. 
  
 
      
 
             
Normally, the MIRO screen appears ready for an invoice to be entere d.  Use the drop-down 
function         to change this to “Credit Memo”.

$500.00 for 25 blankets (the third line item).  Un-select all line items except the one that pertains 
to the credit. 
 
        Since the background of the fields are white, th ey can be changed.  Change the amount to 
correspond to the credit.  Also, change the quantit y to the amount reflected by this credit memo.

Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  119 (May 2008) Subsequent Credit Posting to MIRO 
 
Sometimes a vendor will give a credit for an order.   It is not associated  with a particular good 
that was ordered or returned.  It is a value-only  adjustment and will not affect the quantity.  In 
order to tie this to the PO, use the MIRO function. 
 
 
 
      
 
            Normally, the MIRO screen appears ready for an invoice to be entere d.  Use the drop-down 
function         to change  this to “Subsequent Credit”.

document number for the credit in the Reference fi eld since SAP uses this field to check for 
duplicates. 
 
Enter the amount of the credit for the different line items where you want  it to be applied.  In this 
example, there is a $500.00 credit that will be applied to all three goods line items (the last three line items pictured above are for freight charges).

Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  123 (May 2008) Subsequent Debit Posting to MIRO 
 
Sometimes a subsequent debit needs to be posted and associated with a MIRO invoice.  This is 
ONLY for a legitimate pricing adjustment, such as a debit memo received from the vendor.  It is 
a value-only adjustment and will not affect the quan tity.  In order to tie this to the PO, use the 
MIRO function. 
 
 
      
 
             
Normally, the MIRO screen appears ready for an invoice to be entere d.  Use the drop-down 
function         to change  this to “Subsequent Debit”.

(May 2008) 124 Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification   
  
 
   
 
      
 
          Enter the appropriate information like you would for the original i nvoice.  Be sure to use the 
vendor’s document number for the debit in the Refe rence field since SAP uses this field to check 
for duplicates. 
 
Enter the amount of the debit fo r the different line items where you want it to be applied.  The 
+/- 3% (max $25) still applies to this function.   Therefore, if the debi t is more than a three 
percent difference or more than $25, then  the PO will need to be modified.

(May 2008) 134 Step 3 – Three Way Match: Logistics Invoice Verification  Reversal of Individual L ogistics Invoice Documents 
 
Documents that have been posted in error can eas ily be reversed.  SAP provides functionality to 
automatically generate a reversal document, wh en the user specifies the original document. 
 
 NOTE : An invoice that has already been paid c an not be reversed right away since the 
payment automatically clears the docum ent.  Please call the SAP helpdesk if 
you need to reverse an invoice that has been paid. 
 
Remember that reversal documents cannot be poste d to a period that is already closed.  Usually, 
SAP will use the posting date of the original documen t as the reversal posting date if it is within 
the current period.  The user may specify a differe nt posting date.  It should be in the same 
accounting period as the original doc ument.  If it is determined that an invoice from a previous 
(closed) period needs to be re versed, you must specify an alte rnate posting date because the 
system cannot post to the original. 
 
There are two options for reversing documents.  The first option is to use T-code MR8M.  The 
second option is from the MIRO screen.

Fiscal year Enter the fiscal year in which the docu ment was originally posted.  Remember 
that F&FR uses document numbers t hat are company code dependant and that 
reset themselves after they reach the end of the respective number ranges.  
Therefore a unique document can only be found when both the document 
number, company code and fiscal year are specified in combination.  This 
combination is a unique key in the database that identifies a particular 
document.  
Details for cancellation posting 
Reversal reason Currently, there are three reversal reason  codes that can be used.  This code is 
only used for reporting purposes (i.e. document reports can be executed with 
reversal reason code as a selection criteria).  The valid reason codes are: 
01 Reversal in current period 
02 Reversal in closed period (alt posting date) 
03 Accrual reversal 
 
Reason code # 03 should only be used for self-reversing journals (AJVs).  
Reason code # 01 should be used when the original document to be reversed 
was posted in the current period.  Reas on code # 02 should be used when the 
original document to be reversed was posted in a closed period. 
Posting date This field could be left blank if the posting date for the reversed document is 
similar to that of the original document.  This field must be filled when using 
reversal reason code # 02 - you must indicate the date you want the reversal 
posted (it CANNOT be in a closed period…it must be a date in the current 
period you are using).  This field should be left blank when using reversal reason code # 01.

The GR/IR Clearing (201010) and Freight Clear ing (202012) accounts need to be analyzed 
weekly to ensure that documents are matchi ng up properly.  Sometimes an order will be 
generated using the 3 Way Match process.  Ho wever, when the invoice comes in, it will be 
posted using the Direct Invoice method instead of the Invoice Verification (MIRO) method.  
This results in a credit entry that is never cleared out of the GR/IR Clearing Account and a 
double posting of the expense.

There is a program that can be run if you fi nd line items in the GR/IR and Freight Clearing 
accounts that do not match up.  SAP will reverse the goods receipt in the current period.  The 
system will process a reverse entry to what was or iginally posted, assuming that the original GL 
account (cost element) and cost center are still open and available for postings.  If the goods 
receipt was in a prior fiscal year, you can not sp ecify Prior Fiscal Year Expense.  A GJV would 
need to be done. 
 
 Warning:  Do NOT attempt to do this if the purchase order contains an asset .  If the 
goods receipt was posted to a fixed asse t that has started to depreciate, you 
can not reverse the GR.  Also, you can not reverse a GR that has been posted 
to a 179 project (asset under construction) if the project has been closed. 
Please call the SAP Helpdesk before continuing for asset POs.

(May 2008) 148 Analysis of GR/IR & Freight Clearing Accounts  The report that comes up shows purchase orders where a goods receipt was posted, but not the 
invoice (as a MIRO).  
 
 NOTE : Do  NOT  automatically reverse all of  the documents listed.  You MUST  
research the outstanding documents to see if they really should be reversed.  
Some OCONUS bases have long deliver y times and should be kept in the 
account. 
 If you would like to see the purchase order, c lick on the box to the left of the line item. 
 
 
   
 
      
 Click on the Display Purchase Order icon.                                The PO will appear.  Click the 
green arrow back to return to the report.    Once all of the appropriate line items to be reversed are chosen, click the Post icon.   
A log is created that shows the document number s.  Only one clearing /reversing document is 
created, even if multiple goods rece ipts are chosen.  Remember that the PO is still “Open” and 
will need to be closed.  Please see the Procur ement Advanced manual (“Close Purchase Order 
Line Items”) for more info.

Manually Clear Vendor Line Items  149 (May 2008) Manually Clear Vendor Line Items 
 
Menu Path: ACCOUNTING > FINANCIAL ACCO UNTING > ACCOUNTS PAYABLE 
> ACCOUNT > CLEAR 
  
Transaction code:  F-44 
 
 NOTE : This process should be done after a “payment on account” has been 
performed and the offsetting source documents (i.e., goods receipt and 
invoice) have been received. 
 
A “PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT”  could be done in a situation wher e a prepayment to the vendor is 
required prior to receipt of goods and/or invoice.  For example, a check must be prepared in 
order for the Post Office to authorize a postage me ter increase or a check is necessary for prepaid 
ITT tickets.  The check is prepared as a “Payment on Account”  resulting in a check being written 
with NO offsetting invoice or paperwork.  (See: “HOT CHECKS”  for Payment On Account in the 
Accounts Payable Advanced manual.)  
After receipt of the goods or serv ices, (increased meter postage fr om the Post Office or the ITT 
tickets), the receiving document  should be forwarded to the Accounts Payable Technician for 
processing.  This receipt should be processed as a 
“goods receipt, then invoice verification”  in the 
case of procurement through a purchas e order.  If the direct invoi cing method is used, the receipt 
of the postage or the prepaid tick ets should be used to enter the “invoice” . 
 
Once the invoice has been entered into the system, you will note that the vendor has two “open 
items”  - one invoice and one payment (with matchi ng amounts/items).  However, in the SAP 
system they are unmatched and NOT CLEARED  as are normal payments.  The SAP system cannot 
automatically match these items as is (payment first and invoice second), so MANUAL CLEARING  
is required.  
 NOTE : The automatic payment run program will  handle clearing automatically for most 
routine payments.

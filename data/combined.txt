The image is a graphical representation of the offerings provided by a company called Zomato. It is laid out in a clear and easy-to-read format, with the company's name in a large font at the top of the image, followed by the word "Offerings" which suggests the services they provide.

Below the title, there are four numbered circles, each representing a different service offered by Zomato:

1. Food Delivery: Numbered as "01" with the circle in brown, this service is described as "B2C: Providing food straight to customers' homes with just a few clicks." This indicates that Zomato offers a business-to-consumer (B2C) service that allows customers to order food online and have it delivered to their homes.

2. Dining Out: Numbered as "02" with the circle in red, this service states "B2C: Customers use dining out services to search for restaurants, write reviews, upload images and make payments." This service focuses on facilitating the dining experience by helping customers find restaurants and enabling them to engage with the dining community through reviews and photos. It also suggests that payment can be made through the platform.

3. Zomato Pro: This offering is "03" and connected to the second circle with a dotted line, which implies that it is related to the Dining Out service. It is described as a "B2C: Loyalty program which encompasses both food delivery and dining-out." Zomato Pro appears to be a program that offers benefits across both main consumer services of food delivery and dining out.

4. Hyperpure: Represented by the number "04" with a red circle, this is a "B2B: Supplying ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners." Unlike the previous offerings, this one is business-to-business (B2B), indicating that Zomato also supplies restaurants with ingredients and kitchen products, positioning itself as a partner to other businesses in the food industry.

The graphic uses dotted lines to connect each offering to the description which makes the information easy to follow. The color scheme is predominantly red and brown, consistent with the logo colors of Zomato. The image is informational and appears to be aimed at potential customers or partners, highlighting the diversified services offered by Zomato.i

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE INTRO DUCTION AND 
NATURAL RESOURCES  
 
1.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
The word Environment is derived from the French word “Environ” which means “surrounding”. 
Our surrounding includes biotic factors like human beings, Plants, animals, microbes, etc and 
abiotic factors such as light, air, water, soil, etc. Environment is a c omplex of many variables, 
which surrounds man as well as the living organisms.  
 
Environment includes water, air and land and the interrelation ships which exist among and 
between water, air and land and human beings and other living creatures such as plants, animals 
and micro organisms. She suggested that environment consists of an in separable whole system 
constituted by physical, chemical, biological, social and cultural elements, which are interlinked 
individually and collectively in myriad ways. The natural environment consist of four 
interlinking systems namely, the atmosphere, the  hydrosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere. 
These four systems are in constant change and such changes are affected by human activities and 
vice versa.  
 
Components of Environment  
 
 Environment has been classified into four major components:  
 
1. Hydrosphere ,  
2. Lithosphere ,  
3. Atmosphere ,  
4. Biosphere .  
 
Hydrosphere  includes all water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and ocean etc. 
Hydrosphere functions in a cyclic nature, which is termed as hydrological cycle or water cycle. 
Lithosphere means the mantle of rocks constituting the earth’s crust. The earth is a cold spherical 
solid planet of the solar system, which spins in its axis and revolves around the sun at a certain 
constant distance.  
Lithosphere  mainly, contains soil, earth rocks, mountain etc. Lithosphere is divided into three 
layers -crusts, mantle and core (outer and inner). Atmosphere The cover of the air, that envelope  
the earth is known as the atmosphere.  
Atmosphere  is a thin layer which contains gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide etc. and which 
protects the solid earth and human beings from the harmful radiations of the sun. There are five 
concentric layers within the atmosphere, which can be differentiated on the basis of temperature 
and each layer has its own characteristics. These include the troposphere, the stratosphere, the 
mesosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.  
Biosphere  it is otherwise known as the life layer, it refers to all organisms on the earth’s surface 
and their interaction with water and air. It consists of plants, animals and micro -organisms, 
ranging from the tiniest mic roscopic organism to the largest whales in the sea. Biology is 2 
 concerned with how millions of species of animals, plants and other organisms grow, feed, 
move, reproduce and evolve over long periods of time in different environments. Its subject 
matter is u seful to other sciences and professions that deal with life, such as agriculture, forestry 
and medicine. The richness of biosphere depends upon a number of factors like rainfall, 
temperature, geographical reference etc. Apart from the physical environmenta l factors, the man 
made environment includes human groups, the material infrastructures built by man, the 
production relationships and institutional systems that he has devised. The social environment 
shows the way in which human societies have organized t hemselves and how they function in 
order to satisfy their needs.  
 
1.1.1 MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES  
Environmental science  is an interdisciplinary academic field  that integrates physical and 
biological sciences, (including but not limited to Ecology , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Soil 
Science , Geology , Atmospheric Science  and Geography ) to the study of the environment, and the 
solution of environmental problems. Environmental science provides an integrated, quantitative, 
and interdisciplinary  approach to the study of environmental systems.  
Related areas of study include environmental studies  and environmental engineering . 
Environmental studies incorporate  more of the social sciences for understanding human 
relationships, perceptions and policie s towards the environment. Environmental engineering 
focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality.  
Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating 
alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management , and 
the effects of global climate change . Environmental issues almost always include an interaction 
of physical, chemical, an d biological processes .

1.1.2  SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE  
 
Because of environmental studies has been seen to be multidisciplinary in nature so it is 
considered to be a subject with great scope. Environment is  not limited to issues of sanitation and 
health but it is now concerned with pollution control, biodiversit y conservation, waste 
management and conservation of natural resources. This requires expert eyes and hence is  
creating new job opportunities. The opportunities in this field are immense not only for scientists 
but also for engineers, biologists. There is a good chance of opportunity to find a job in this field 
as environmental journalists. Environmental science can be applied in the following spheres:  
 
Ecosystem  Structure and  Function  
 
The study of ecosystems mainly consists of the study of the processes that link the leaving 
organism or in other words biotic component to the non -living organism or a biotic  component. 
So for the study of environment we should aware with biotic and a biot ic components.  
 
Natural  Resource  Conservation  
 
For managing and maintenance of forests which are natural resources and for the maintenance of 
wildlife forms task under natural resource conservation. It is also a scope of environmental 
studies  
 
Environmental  Pollution  Control  
 
With  the knowledge of environmental science everybody can control the pollution. He/she can 
handle the waste management and also look for ways to control pollution on the aspect of 
pollution control.  
 
Environmental  management  
 
There are several independent environmental consultants who are working with Central and State 
pollution control Board. They offer advice to solve the problems of environment the optimum 
solution for the upcoming problems. They gi ve direction for controlling pollution due to 
industrial development. There are several current consultants who are working with government 
pollution control boobs, involved in po licy making, pollution control and maintenance  of 
ecological balance.  
 
The scope  of environmental  studies  in industry  
 
Environmental scientist’s  work towards maintenance of ecological balance, they also work 
towards conservation of biodiversity and regulation of natural resources as well as on 
preservation of natural resources. Most of the industries have a separate environmental research 
and deve lopment section. These sections govern the impact that their industry has on the 
environment. Our environment is being degraded by the rapid industrialization. To combat this 4 
 menace there is a growing trend towards manufacture of "green" goods and products . So we can 
say that there is a good scope in the field of industry from environmental studies.  
 
Research  and development  
 
Research and development have  tremendous scope due to increment in public awareness 
regarding the environment. Various universities a nd governmental organizations offer a scope 
for such research. These universities conduct research studies in order to develop the methods 
toward monitoring and controlling the source of environmental pollution. Due to an increasing 
threat from global warm ing, many steps are being undertaken for the reduction of greenhouse 
gases and the adoption of renewable energy resources. They generate awareness now regarding 
the use of solar energy for variety of purposes. This provides  scope of environmental history in 
the field of research and development.  
 
Social Development  
 
NGO ( Nongovernmental organizations) help  in creating awareness regarding the protection of 
the environment and making the masses aware of various environmental i ssues . They also 
generate a public opinion in this field. They work towards disseminating information and in 
bringing about changes in political policies that are personally effect the environment. The social 
dimension of this profession includes controll ing population explosion through organizing 
advisory awareness camps.  
 
1.1.3  IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE  
 
The environment studies enlighten us, about the importance of protection and conservation of 
our indiscriminate release of pollution into the environment.  
 
Environment science has become  significant for the following reasons:  
 
1.Environment Issues Being of International Importance  
 
It has been well recognized  that environment issues like global warming and ozone depletion , 
acid rain, marine pollution and biodiversity are not merely national issues but are  global issues 
and hence must be tackled with international efforts and cooperation.  
 
2. Problems Cropped in t he Wake of Development  
 
Development, in its wake gave birth to Urbanization, Industrial Growth, and Transportation  
Systems, Agriculture and Housing etc. However, it has become phased out in the developed  
World . The North, to cleanse their own environment has fact fully, managed to move ‘dirty’  
Factories  of South. When the West developed, it did so perhaps in ignorance of the  
Environmental  impact of its activities. Evidently such a path is neither practicable nor  desirable, 
even if developing world follows that.  
 
 
 
 5 
 3. Explosively Increase in Pollution  
 
World census reflects that one in every seven persons in this planted lives in India.  Evidently 
with 16 per cent of the world's population and only 2.4 per cent of its land area,  there is a heavy 
pressure on the natural resources including land. Agricultural experts have  recognized soils 
health problems like deficiency of micronutrients and  organic matter, soil  salinity and damage of 
soil structure.  
 
4. Need to Save Humanity from  Extinction  
 
It is incumbent upon us to save the humanity from extinction . Consequent to our activities  
Constricting  the environment and depleting the biosphere, in the  name of development.  
 
5. Need for Wise Planning of Development  
 
Our survival and sustenance depend. Resources withdraw, processing and use of the  product 
have all to by synchronized  with the ecological cycles in any plan of development our  actions 
should be planned ecologically for the sustenance of the environment and development.  
 
1.1.4  NEED FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS  
 
It is essential to make the public aware of the formidable consequenc es of the  Environmental 
Degradation, if not retorted and reformative measures undertaken  would  result in the extinction 
of life. We are facing various environmental challenges. It is essential  to get the country 
acquainted with these challenges so that the ir acts may be eco -friendly.  
 
Some of these challenges are as under:  
 
1.Growing Population  
A population of over thousands of millions is growing at 2.11 per cent every year. Over  17 
million people are added each year. It puts considerable pressure on its natural resources  and 
reduces the gains of development. Hence, the greatest challenge before us is to limit the  
population growth. Although population control does automatically lead to development, yet  the 
development leads to a decrease in population gro wth rates. For this development of the  women 
is essential.  
 
2. Poverty  
India has often been described a rich land with poor people. The poverty and  environmental 
degradation have a nexus between them. The vast majority of our people are  directly dependent 
on the nature resources of the country for their basic needs of food, fuel  shelter and fodder. 
About 40% of our people are still below the poverty line. Environment  degradation has adversely 
affected the poor who depend upon the resources of their immediat e surroundings . Thus, the 
challenge of poverty and the challenge environment degradation are  two facets of the same 
challenge. The population growth is essentially a function of poverty . Because, to the very poor, 
every child is an earner and helper and global concerns have  little relevance for him.  
 
 
 6 
 3. Agricultural Growth  
The people must be ac quainted with the methods to sustain and increase agricultural  growth with 
damaging the environment. High yielding varieties  have caused soil salinity and  damage to 
physical structure of soil.  
 
4. Need to Ground water  
It is essential of rationalizing the u se of groundwater. Factors like community wastes,  industrial 
effluents and chemical fertilizers and pesticides have polluted our surface water  and affected 
quality of the groundwater. It is essential to restore the water quality of our  rivers and other wat er 
bodies as lakes are  an important challenge. It so finding our suitable  strategies for consecration 
of water, provision of safe drinking water and keeping water  bodies clean which are difficult 
challenges is essential.  
 
5. Development and Forests  
Forests serve catchments for the rivers. With increasing demand of water, plan to  harness the 
mighty river through large irrigation projects were made. Certainly, these  would submerge 
forests; displace local people, damage flora and fauna. As such, the dam s on the river Narmada, 
Bhagirathi and elsewhere have become areas of political and scientific  Debate . 
 
1.2 NATURAL RESOURCES  
 
The word resource means a source of supply. The natural resources include water , air, soil, 
minerals, coal, forests, crops and wildlife are examples. All the resources  are classified based on 
quantity, quality, re -usability, men’s activity and  availability . 
 
Natural resources  are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their 
relatively unmodified ( natural ) form. A natural resource’s value rests in the amount of the 
material available and the demand  for it.  The term was introduced to a broad audience by E.F. 
Schumacher  in his 1970s book Small is Beautiful . 
 
a) Renewable resource  or inexhaustible resources  
The renewable resources  can maintain themselves or can be replaced if managed wisely . These 
resources are constantly renewed in nature. The renewable resources are therefore not likely to 
be lost due to excessive and unwise use.  
 
b) Non-renewable resources  or exhaustible resources   
These resources once used are lost forever, as they are not restored.  They include metallic 
minerals and fossil fuels. At current rates  of usage, all the industrial  metals may lose for less than 
a century and those of petroleum and natural gas may exhaust in 15 -20 years.  
 
Natural Resources and Associated Problems  
Human population is growing day -by-day. Continuous increase in population caused an 
increasing demand for natural resources. Due to urban expansion, electricity need and 
industrialization, man started utilizing  natural resources at a much larger scale. Non -renewable 
resources are limited.  They cannot be replaced easily. After some time, these resources may 
come to an end. It is a matter of much concern and ensures a balance between population growth 
and utilization  of resources.  This overutilization  creates  many problems. In some regions there 7 
 are problems of water logging due to over irrigation. In some areas, there is no sufficient water 
for industry and agriculture. Thus, there is need for conservation of natural resources.  
There are many problems associa ted with natural resources:  
Forest resources  and associated problems  
1. Use and over -exploitation.  
2. Deforestation.  
3. Timber extraction.  
4. Mining and its effects on forest.  
5. Dams and their effects on forests and tribal people.  
Water resources and associated problems  
1. Use and overutilization of water.  
2. Floods, droughts etc.  
3. Conflicts over water.  
4. Dams and problems.  
Mineral resource and associated problems  
1. Use and exploitation.  
2. Environmental effects of extracting and using minerals.  
Food resources and associated problems  
1. World food problems.  
2. Changes caused by agriculture and over grazing.  
3. Effects of modern agriculture.  
4. Fertilizer -pesticide problems.  
5. Water logging and salinity.  
Energy resources and associated problems  
1. Growing energy needs.  
Land resources and associated problems  
1. Land degradation.  
2. Man -induced landslides.  
3. Soil erosion and desertification.  
 
1.3 FOREST RESOURCES  
 
Forests are one of the most important natural resources and a part of biosphere since  these are 
natural assets on this earth. Forests predominantly composed of  trees, shrubs, woody vegetation 
etc… Approximately 1/3rd of the earth’s total land  area is cover ed by forests.  Forests are 
important ecologically and economically. Ecologically forests are to be  considered as earth’s 
lungs because they consume CO 2 and release O 2which is required for sustaining the life on this 
earth. The poisonous gas CO 2 is absorbed  by the trees of forests and reduces  the global warming 
and helps to  continue hydrologi cal cycle, reduce soil erosion.  Forest ecosystems are extremely 
good & hold a good quantity of water.  
Economically forests provide timber, fodder to grazing animals, fir ewood(conventional fuel), 
bamboos, rubbers, medicines, gums, resins, food items etc.  8 
  
 
USES OF FOREST  
 
1. Watershed  protection:  
• Reduce the rate of surface run -off of water.  
• Prevent flash floods and soil erosion.  
• Produces prolonged gradual run-off and thus prevent effects of drought.  
2. Atmospheric  regulation:  
• Absorption of solar heat during evapo -transpiration.  
• Maintaining carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.  
• Maintaining the local climatic conditions.  
3. Erosion  control:  
• Holding soil (by preventing rain from directly washing soil away).  
4. Land  bank:  
• Maintenance of soil nutrients and structure.  
5. Local  use - Consumption of forest produce by local people who collect it for subsistence – 
(Consumptive use)  
• Food - gathering plants, fishing, hunting from the forest. (In the past when wildlife was  
Plentiful , people could hunt and kill animals for food. Now those populations  of most  
Wildlife  species have diminished;  continued hunting would lead to extinction .) 
• Fodder - for cattle.  
• Fuel wood and charcoal for cooking, heating.  
• Poles - building homes especially in rural and wilderness areas.  
• Timber – household articles and construction.  
• Fiber - weaving of baskets, ropes, nets, string, etc.  
• Sericultur e – for silk.  
• Apiculture - bees for honey, forest bees also pollinate crops.  
• Medicinal plants - traditionally used medicines, investigating them as potential  Source  for new 
modern drugs.  
6. Market  use - (Productive use)  
• Most of the above products use d for consumptive purposes are also sold as source  of  income 
for supporting the livelihoods of forest dwelling people.  
• Minor forest produce - (non-wood products): Fuel wood , fruit, gum, fiber, etc.which are 
Collected  and sold in local markets as a source of income for forest dwellers . 
• Major timber extraction - construction, industrial uses, paper pulp, etc. Timber extraction  is 
done  in India by the Forest Department, but illegal logging continues in  many of the fore sts of  
India and the world.

 OVER EXPLOITATION OF FOREST S 
 
 Forest has been known to possess huge potential for human use and they have been exploited 
since early times for their vast potential. Exploitation of forest has taken place to meet human 
demands in the following ways:  
 
- Due to wood cutting and large scale logging fo r raw materials like timber, 
pulp wood, fuel wood etc  
- Deforestation due to road construction  
- Clearing of  forest to create more agricultural lands to meet the food needs 
of growing population  
- Encroachment of forests leading to destruction of about 19.57 lakh 
hectares  (2013) of forest  in the country  
- About 78% of forest area is under heavy grazing  
- Mining activities leads to clearing of forests  
- Big hydro electric projects result in large scale destruction of forest  
 
In India, Joint forest management  has come up as innovative  approach involving community 
participation so that the rural economy is strengthened as well as forest resources are conserved 
through public involvement  
 
DEFORESTATION  
 
Deforestation is the permanent destruction of indigenous forests and woodlands. The term does 
not include the removal of industrial forests such as plantations of gums or pines. Deforestation 
has resulted in the reduction of indigenous forests to four -fifths of their pre -agricultural area. 
Indigenous forests now cover 21% of the earth's land surface.  Deforestation refers to the loss of 
forest cover (or) the aimless destruction of trees. The clearing of forests across the earth has been 
occurring on a large scale basis for many centuries. This process i nvolves the cutting down, 
burning and damaging of forests.  Currently 12 million hectares of forests are cleared annually 
and the current rate of deforestation continues, the world’s forests will vanish within the next 100 
years about 80% of the original fo rests on the earth have  already been cleared.  
 
Major causes of Deforestation:  
 
a. Shifting cultivation  : There are an estimated 300 million people living as shifting cultivators who 
practice slash and burn agriculture and are supported so clear more than 5 lakh ha of forests for 
shifting cultivation annually. In India, we have this practice of North -East a nd to some extent in 
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar  and M.P. which contribute to nearly half of the forest clearing annually.  
b. Fuel requirements : Increasing demands for fuel wood by the growing population in India alone 
has shooted up to 300 -500 million tons in 2 001 as compared to just 65 million tons during 
independence, thereby increasing the pressure on forests.  
c. Raw materials for industrial use : Wood for making boxes, furniture, railway -sleepers, plywood, 
match boxes, pulp for paper industry etc. have exerte d tremendous pressure on forests. Plywood 10 
 is in great demand for packing tea for  Tea industry of Assam while fir tree wood is exploited 
greatly for packing apples in J & K.  
d. Development projects : Massive destruction of forests occurs for various developm ent projects 
like hydroelectric projects, big dams, road construction, mining etc.  
e. Growing food needs : In developing countries this is the main reason for  deforestation. To meet 
the demands of rapidly growing population, agricultural lands and settlemen ts are created 
permanently by clearing forests.  
f. Overgrazing : The poor in the tropics mainly rely on wood as a source of fuel leading to loss of 
tree cover and the cleared lands are turned into the grazing lands. Overgrazing by the cattle leads 
to furthe r degradation of these lands.  
g. Conversion of forests and woodlands to agricultural land to feed growing numbers of people  
Major activities and threats to  Forests  resources : 
 
1.Timber Extraction:  Logging  for valuable timber, such as teak and Mahogany not only  involves a 
few large trees per hectare but about a dozen more trees since they  are strongly interlocked with 
each other a by vines etc. Also road construction  for making approach to the trees causes further 
damage to the  forests. The  steps in timber extraction are:  
  a) Clear  felling  
  b) Mechanized  logging  
  c) Manual  logging  
  d) Selective  logging  
 
2. Mining : Mining operations for extracting minerals and fossil fuels like coal often involves  vast 
forest areas. Mining from shallow deposits is done by surface mining  while that from deep 
deposits is done by sub -surface mining. More than80000 ha of land of the cou ntry is presently 
under the stress of mining activities. Mining  and its associated activities require removal of 
vegetation along with underlying  soil mantle and overlying rock masses. This results in defacing 
the topography  and destruction of the landscap e in the area. Large  scale deforestation has been 
reported in Mussorie and Dehradun valley due  to indiscriminating mining of various minerals 
over a length of about 40 Km.  
 
DAMS AND OTHER EFFECTS ON FOREST AND TRIBAL PEOPLE  
 
Forest are directly are indirectly effected by the forest. Hydro -electric dams are main cause for 
deforestation. About 40,000 large dams are currently obstructing  Workloads Rivers. Destruction 
of forest occurs  for constructing big dams, which alters ecological balance. In these w ay 
landslides , droughts and floods conditions may rise in area. Socio -economic problems related  to 
tribal and native people  results from big dam  construction  
Dam construction produces a number of health hazards. Thousands of workers who build the 
dams attacked by the diseases like AIDS, measles, tuberculosis, syphilis etc . Dam building has 
resulted  in wide range human rights violations. Rehabilitation policy of the government is 11 
 important and typical when most of the displaced persons are tribal people.  Tribal life and 
culture are mostly associated with forest  
CASE STUDIES:  
 
Chipko movement related to mining or quarrying opposed by SundarlalBahuguna in North India. 
The first Chipko action took place spontaneously in April 1973 and over the next five year s 
spread to many districts of the Himalaya in Uttar Pradesh. The name of the movement comes 
from a word meaning 'embrace': the villagers hug the trees, saving them by interposing their 
bodies between them and the contractors' axes. The Chipko protests in U ttar Pradesh achieved a 
major victory in 1980 with a 15 -year ban on green felling in the Himalayan forests of that state 
by order of India's then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Since then the movement has spread to 
Himachal Pradesh in the North, Kamataka i n the South, and Rajasthan  in the West, Bihar in the 
East and to the Vindhyas in Central India. In addition to the 15 -year ban in Uttar Pradesh, the 
movement has stopped clear felling in the Western Ghats and the Vindhyas and generated 
pressure for a natur al resource policy which is more sensitive to people's needs and ecological 
requirements.

1.4 WATER RESOURCES  
Water resources  are sources of water  that are useful or potentially useful. Uses of water include 
agricultural , industrial , household , recreational  and environmental  activities. Virtually all of 
these human uses require fresh water . 
Distribution of water on earth:  
• 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water. Only three percent is fresh water; slightly 
over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers  and polar ice . The remaining unfrozen 
freshwater is fou nd mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above 
ground or in the air  
Fresh water occurs mainly in two forms  
1. Ground  water and 2. Surface water  
 
1. Groundwater:  About 9.86% of the total fresh water resources is in the form of  groundwater 
and it is about 35 -50 times that of surface water supplied  
 
USES OF WATER:  
 
1. DOMESTIC USE: Water used in the houses for the purposes of drinking, bathing, 
washing Clothes , cooking , sanitary & other needs. The recommended value according to 
Indian standard specification for domestic use is 135 liters/day  
2. INDUSTRIAL USE: Water is required for various industries such as cement, mining , 
textile , leather industries.  
3. PUBLIC USE: This includes water used for public utility purpose such as watering parks,  
Flushing streets, jails etc.  
4. FIRE USE: Water is used in case of accidents and to prevent the fire issues.  12 
 5. IRRIGATION: To grow crops which is the main sources for  food?  
6. OTHER USES: Hydro electric power generation requires water.  
 
 
OVER UTILIZATION OF GROUND WATER AND SURFACE WATER  
 
Over use of groundwater has following effects.  
1. Lowering of water table:  Excessive use of ground water for drinking, irrigation  and 
Domestic  purposes has resulted in rapid depletion of ground water in various  regions 
leading to lowering of water table & drying of wells.  
The reasons for shortage of water are:  
a. Increase in population,  
b. Increasing demand of water for various purposes.  
c. Unequal distribution of fresh water.  
d. Increasing pollution of water sources cause over exploitation.  
2. Ground subsidence:  When ground water withdrawal is greater than its rec harge  rate,  the 
sediments in the aquifer become compacted. This is called ground  subsidence which  may cause 
damage of buildings, destroy water supply systems  etc. 
3. Drought. A  drought  is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a 
deficiency  in its water supply whether surface or underground water. Generally, this occurs when 
a region receives  consistently below average precipitation . 
We can define  drought in four  main ways:  
a) Meteorological drought:  related to rainfall amounts  
b) Hydrological drought:  determined by water levels in  reservoirs  
c) Agricultural drought:  related to  the availability  of water for crops    
d) Socioeconomic  Drought:  related  to demand and supply of economic 
goods  
  a) Meteorological  Drought:  Meteorological  drought is generally defined by comparing the 
rainfall  in a particular place and at a particular time with the average rainfall for that Place .  The 
definition is, therefore, specific to a particular location.   Meteorological drought  leads to a 
depletion of soil moisture and this almost always has an impact on crop  production.  
 
b) Hydrological Drought:  Hydrological  drought is associated with the effect of low rainfall on 
water levels in rivers,  reservoirs,  lakes and aquifers. Hydrological droughts usually are noticed  
some time after meteorological droughts. First precipitation decreases and , Sometime  after that, 
water levels in rivers and lakes drop . 
 
 C) Agricultural Drought : Agricultural drought mainly effects food production and farming.   
Agricultural drought and precipitation shortages bring soil water deficits, reduced ground water  
or reservoir levels, and so on. Deficient topsoil moisture at planting  may stop  germination, 
leading  to low plant populations.  
 
d) Socioeconomic Drought : Socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic  
good exceeds supply as a result of a weather -related shortfall in water supply.  The supply of 
many economic goods, such as water, forage, food grains, fish, and hydroelectric  power, depends  
on weather. Due to variability of climate, water supply is sufficient  in some years but not 
satisfactory to meet human and environmental needs in other  year 
 13 
  
 
FLOOD S 
A flood  is an overflow of water that submerges land which is normally dry. The European Union  
(EU) Floods Directive  defines a flood as a covering by water  of land not normally covered  by 
water . Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river  or lake, in 
which the water overtops or breaks, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, 
or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an area flood . Floods 
can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the  capacity of the river channel , particularly 
at bends in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the 
natural flood plains of rivers.  
CONFL ICTS OVER WATER  
Water conflict  is a term describing a conflict between countries, states, or groups over an access 
to water resources . The United Nations  recognizes that water disputes result from opposing 
interests of water users, public or private.  
A wide range of water conflicts appear throughout history, though rarely are traditional wars 
waged over water alone. Instead, water has historically been a source of tension and a factor in 
conflicts that start for other reasons. However, water conflicts arise for several reasons, including 
territorial disputes, a fight for resources, and strategic advantage.  
These conflicts occur over both freshwater  and saltwater , and between international boundaries. 
Howeve r, conflicts occur mostly over freshwater; because freshwater resources are necessary, 
yet limited, they are the center of water disputes arising out of need for potable water . As 
freshwater is a vital, yet unevenly distributed natural resource, its availability often impacts the 
living  and economic conditions of a country or region. The lack of co st-effective water 
desalination  techniques in areas like the Middle East, among other elements of water crises  can 
put severe pressures on all water users  
According to the 1992 International Conference on Water and the Environment, Water is a vital 
element for human life, and an y human activity relates somehow to water. Unfortunately, it is 
not a renewable resource and in the future it "might get worse with climate change  
Water conflicts occur because the demand for water resources and potable water  extend far 
beyond the amount of water actually available. Elements of a water crisis  may put pressures on 
affected parties to obta in more of a shared water resource, causing diplomatic tension or outright 
conflict.  
The Cauvery water dispute : Out of Indias 18 major rivers, 17 are shared between different 
states.  In all these cases, there are intense conflicts over these resources whi ch badly seem to 
resolve. The Cauvery river water is a born of contention between tamilnadu and Karnataka and 
the proble m is almost hundred years old. T amilnadu occupying the downstream region of the 
river wants water -use regulated in the upstream state Ka rnataka refuses to do so and claims its 
privacy over the river as upstream user. The river water is almost fully utilized and both the 14 
 states having increasing demands for agriculture and industry. The consumption is more in 
Tamilnadu than Karnataka where the catchment area is rockier. On June 2, 1990, the Cavery 
Water dispute tribunal was set up which through an interim award directed Karnataka to ensure 
that 205 TMCF of water was made available in Tamilnadus mettur dam every year, till a 
settlement was re ached. In 1991 -92 due to good monsoon, there was no disputr as there was 
good stock of water in Mettur , but in 1995, the situation turned into a crisis due to delayed rains 
and an expert committee was set up to look into the matter which found there was a  complex 
cropping pattern in Cauvery basin. Sambra paddy in winter, Kurvai paddy in summer and some 
cash crops demanded intensive water, thus aggravating the water crisis. Proper selection of crop 
varieties, optimum use of water, better rationing and ratio nal sharing patterns, and pricing of 
water are suggested as some measures to solve the problem.  
DAMS -BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS  
 
Today there are more than 45,000 large dams around the world, which play an important role in 
communities and economies that harness  these water resources for their economic development. 
Current estimates suggest some 30 -40% of irrigated land worldwide relies on dams. 
Hydropower, another contender for the use of stored water, currently supplies 19% of the 
world’s total electric power s upply and is used in over 150 countries. The world’s two most 
populous countries – China and India – have built around 57% of the world’s large  dams.  
 
BENEFITS:  
 
 River valley projects with big dams have usually been considered to play a key role  in the 
development process due to their  multiple uses. India has the distinction of having the largest 
number of river valley projects.  The tribal’s living in the area pi n big hopes on these projects as 
they aim at providing employment  and raising the standard and quality of life. The dams have 
tremendous potential for economic upliftment and growth. They can help in checking floods and 
famines, generate electricity and re duce water and power shortage, provide irrigation water to 
lower areas, provide drinking water in remote  areas and promote navigation, fishery etc  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
• Fragmentation and physical transformation of rivers.  
• Serious impacts on riverine ecosystems.  
• Social consequences of large dams due to displacement of people.  
• Water logging and Stalinization  of surrounding lands.  
• Dislodging animal populations, damaging their habitat and cutting off their migration routes.  
• Fishing and travel by b oat disrupted.  
Large dams have had serious impacts on the lives, livelihoods, cultures and spiritual existence  of 
indigenous and tribal peoples. They have suffered disproportionately from the negative Impacts  
of dams and often been excluded from sharing th e benefits. In India, of the 16 to 18  million 
people displaced by dams, 40 to 50% were tribal people, who account for only 8% of  our 
nation’s one billion people.

1.5 MINERAL RESOURCES  
A mineral is a naturally occurring substance of definite chemical composition and identifiable  
physical properties. An ore is a mineral or combination of minerals from which a useful 
substance, such as a metal, can be extracted and used to manufacture a useful product.  
The geological processes are caused for the  formation of the minerals over millions  of years ago 
in the earth’s crust. Minerals are generally localized in occurrence and the deposits are very 
sporadic in distribution. Mineral resources are non renewable and the mineral /ore is extracted by 
the proc ess of mining.  
Iron, aluminum, zinc, manganese  and copper are important raw materials for industrial use. 
Important non -metal resources  include coal, salt, clay, cement and silica. Stone used for building 
material, such as granite , marble, limestone, const itute another category of minerals. Minerals 
with special properties that humans value for their aesthetic and ornamental value are gems such 
as diamonds, emeralds and  rubies . The luster of gold, silver and platinum is used for ornaments. 
Minerals in the form of oil, gas and coal were formed when ancient plants and animals were 
converted into underground fossil fuels.  
 
Uses of minerals:  
Minerals are used in a large number of ways for domestic, industrial, commercial  
Sectors  etc…  
1. Generation  of energy by using coal ( lignite / anthracite) ; uranium, gold , silver, platinum, 
diamond are used in jewellery. Copper, aluminum etc are used  as cables for transmission of 
power.  
2. Some  of the minerals are used in ayurvedam as medicine.  
Gold is  reputed to strengthen the heart muscle and increase energy and stamina.  
 
Mining and its Process:  
Minerals and their ores need to be extracted from the earth’s interior so that they can be used . 
This process is known as mining. Mining  is the extraction of valuable minerals  or other 
geolo gical  materials from the earth, from an ore body , lode, vein, (coal) seam or reef, which 
forms the mineralized horizon and package of economic interest to the miner.  
Mining operations generally progress through four stages : 
(1) Prospecting: Searching for minerals.  
(2) Exploration: Assessing the size, shape, location,  
(3) Development:  Work of preparing access to the deposit so that the minerals can be extracted     
from it.  
(4) Exploitation : Extracting the minerals from the mines . 
 
Types of mining:  
The method of mining has to be determined depending on whether the ore or mineral deposit  is 
nearer the surface or deep within the earth. The topography of the region and the  Physical  nature 
of the ore deposit is studied.  Mines are of two types  
 a) Surface  (open cut or strip mines)   
 b) Deep  or shaft mines.  16 
 a) Surface Mining : Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are close to Earth’s 
Surface . The soil and rocks over the ore are removed by blasting. Typically, the remaining ore is 
drilled or blasted so that large machines can fill trucks with the broken rocks. The trucks take the 
rocks to factories where the ore will be separated from the rest of the rock.  Surface mining 
includes open -pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining.  
1)   Open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. The size of the pit grows 
until it is no longer profitable to mine the remaining ore.  
2) Strip  mines are similar to pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips.  
3)  A quarry is a type  of open -pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to 
make buildings.  
b) Underground  Mining:  Underground  mining is used for ores that are deep in Earth's surface. 
For deep ore deposits, it can be too expensive to remove all of the rocks above the ore. 
Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 
meters deep (th at is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. 
These methods are more expensive than surface mining because tunnels are made in the rock so 
that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fres h air 
and lights must also be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. Miners breathe in lots of 
particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the 
surrounding roc k and taken out of the tunnel  
Environmental ef fects:  
Mineral extraction and processing in mines involves a negative impact on environment. Much 
risk is involved in mining process because of high temperature, pressure  Variations , fire hazards 
and lack of ventilation in mines.  
 
• Mining process involves removal of over burden of soil, ore extraction & transportation, 
crushing & grinding of ore, water treatment of ore, storage of waste material. As a result 
of these activities cause air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution, loss of habitat of 
wildli fe, concentration of toxic substances in tailing ponds and spreading of dust.  
• People working in mines often suffer from serious respiratory system and skin diseases.  
• Mining often causes ground subsidence which results in tilting of buildings, cracks in 
houses, buckling of roads, bending of rail tracks etc.  
• Exploration process before a mining involves, geochemical, geophysical surveys  
             Drilling  activities which causes for air pollution, noise pollution etc ...  
• In addition, disturbance of all veg etation (flora)  and fauna (animals)  from that a region.  
• Acid mine drainage  (AMD), or acid rock drainage  (ARD): The outflow of acidic  water 
from (usually abandoned) metal mines  or coal mines . However, other areas where the 
earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, transportation corridors, 
etc.) may also contribute acid rock drainage to the en vironment  
 
1.6 FOOD RESOURCES  
 
The main sources of human food are plants and animals. Human beings consume almost all parts 
of plants in the form of cereals  (wheat, barley, millet, rye, oats, maize, corn, rice etc.); pulses 
(peas, red grams, green grams); vegetables  (carrot, cauliflower, beans); fruits  (banana, orange, 
grapes, pineapple) and spices  (pepper, cloves). Also a number of products such as  milk, butter, 
egg and meat supplement the requirements.  17 
  
WORLD FOOD PROBLEMS  
 
Since world’s population is growing every year and the demand of food is also increasing  
continuously. Although world’s food production has increased almost three  times during the last 
50 years, but at the same time rapid population growth outstripped  the food production. So, the 
world food problem is a complex one depending  on food production, population increase, the 
prevalence of poverty and environmental  impacts.  
Famines are due to lack of access to food but not lack of food. Modern agriculture  is largely 
based upon technological factors like the use of improved seeds , chemical fertilizers, synthetic 
pesticides etc…  
The green revolution  however changed traditional agricultural practices with a rapid  increase in 
food production in deve loping countries. An American agricultural  scientist, Norman Borlaug 
developed a high yielding variety of wheat  through new concepts in plant breeding. By the mid 
1960’s,  the green revolution  was fully adopted in India.  
 
CHANGES CAUSED BY  AGRICULTURE  AND  OVER GRAZING  
 
CHANGES CAUSED BY AGRICULTURE  
 
There are two types of agricultural systems:  
(1) Traditional system and (2) Modern and Industrialized system  
 
(1) Traditional system:  
The traditional system is again subdivided into two types namely:  
(a) Traditional Subsistence Agriculture  (TSA) : In this system, only enough crops or livestock  
Are produced for the use of family and a little surplus to sell to meet the needs.  
(b) Traditional Intensive Agriculture ( TIA ): Farmers increase their inputs of huma n labor ,  
       Water  fertilizers to get higher yields for the use of their families  and to sell small quantities  
for getting income.  
 
(2) Modern and industrialized  system:  In the system of modern and industrialized 
agriculture , a large extent of land  will be brought under agriculture and huge quantities of fuel, 
energy,  
water, chemical fertilizers, pesticides used to produce large quantities of single crops  purely for 
sale. This system is spreading in India in the name of Green  revolution . But this modern 
agricultural system has its own adverse effects on environment . 
     a. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers to boost up the crop yield, contaminate  groundwater 
with nitrate. The presence of excess of nitrate in drinking  water  is dangerous for human Health . 
Excess Nitrate reacts with  hemoglobin  and causes for “Blue  Baby Syndrome ” which  kill the 
infants.  
     b. The excessive N P K fertilizers in agriculture fields are often washed off with  water and 
leads  to algal blooming  and Eutrophication . Phosphates  have  been accumulating in soils, lake 
sediments for decades change the ecology. Increased  levels of phosphates in water  bodies cause 
Eutrophication ( growth of unwanted  plants ).  
    c. The excessive use of pesticides enter s the food chain and become hazardous  to human life.  
    d. A large area of fertile land has become saline in recent years due to excessive  irrigation.  18 
     e. Consumption of fuel energy is more when shifting of human and animal  labour to 
agriculture  machinery. Use of fuel leads to air pollution.  
     f. Continuing to increase input of fertilizers, water and pesticides eventually produces  no  
Additional  increase in crop yield but slows down the productivity of the  crop.  
     g. Due to incre ased irrigation, the underground aquifers are slowly and constantly become 
dry. The rate at which they are being depleted is much faster  than its recharge.  
     h. Excessive application of chemical fertilizers can increase soil salt content . The percolatio n 
 of domestic and industrial sewage also increase the salinity  of soil.  
      i. The stagnation of water in the soil in the upper layers causes for water logging  which  
Causes  for less oxygen availability for respiration of plants.  
 
Modern, intensive agriculture causes many problems, including the following:  
• Artificial fertilizers and herbicides are easily washed from the soil and pollute rivers, lakes and    
    Water  courses.  
• The prolonged use of artificial fertilizers results in soils with a low organic matter content  
    Which is easily eroded by wind and rain?  
• Dependency on fertilizers. Greater amounts are needed every year to produce the same Yields  
of crops.  
• Artificial pesticides can stay in the soil for a long time and enter the food chain where they  
    build up in the bodies of animals and humans, causing health problems.  
• Artificial chemicals destroy soil micro -organisms resulting in poor soil structu re and aeration  
    and decreasing nutrient availability.  
• Pests and diseases become more difficult to control as they become resistant to artificial            
Pesticides . The numbers of natural enemies decrease because of pesticide use and habitat loss . 
 
WATER LOGGING  
Water logging  refers to the saturation of soil with water . Soil may be regarded as waterlogged 
when the water table  of the groundwater  is too high to con veniently permit a n anticipated 
activity, like agriculture . In agriculture, various crops  need air (specifically, oxygen ) to a greater 
or lesser depth in the soil. Water logging  of the soil stops air getting in. How near the water table 
must be to the surface for the ground to be classed as waterlogged  varies with the purpose in 
view. A crop's demand for freedom from water logging  may vary between seasons of the year, as 
with the growing of rice (Oryza sativa ). 
In irrigated  agricultural land, water logging  is often accompanied by soil salinity  as waterlogged 
soils prevent leaching  of the salts imported by the irrigation water  
SALINITY  
Soil salinity  is the salt content in the soil; the process of increasing the salt content is known as 
salin ization . Salt is a natural e lement of soils and water. Saliniz ation can be caused by natural 
processes such as mineral weathering or the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also be 
caused by artificial processes such as irrigation  
Saliniza tion is a process that results from:  
• High  levels of salt in the water.  19 
 • Landscape  features that allow salts to become mobile(movement of water table).  
• Climatic  trends that favors  accumulation.  
• Human  activities such as land clearing, aquaculture  activities and the salting of icy roads.  
 
CHANGES CAUSED BY OVER GRAZING  
Overgrazing  occurs when plants are exposed to intensive grazing  for extended periods of time, 
or without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either livestock  in poorly managed 
agricultural  applications, or by overpopulations of native  or native wild . Overgrazing reduces the 
usefulness, productivity , and biodiversity  of the land and is one cause of desertification  and 
erosion . Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of invasive species  of non-native plants  
and of weeds . Overgrazing typically increases soil erosion . Reduction in soil depth, soil organic 
matter and soil fertility impair the land's future natural and agricultural productivity. Soil fertility 
can sometimes be mitigat ed by applying the appropriate lime and organic fertilizers . However, 
the loss of soil depth and organic matter takes centuries to correct. Their loss is critical in 
determining the soil's water -holding capacity and how well pasture plants do during dry weather.  
 
1.7 ENERGY RESOURCES  
 
Energy is defined by physicists as the capacity to do work . Energy is found on ourplanet in a 
variety of forms, some of which are immediately useful to do work, while others require a 
process of transformation.  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but transformed from one 
form to other. Energy is closely related to force. When a force causes an object to move, energy 
is being transferred from the force to kinetic energy.  Energy is present in a number of forms such 
as mechanical, thermal, chemical, biological energy etc.. Energy production and utilization have 
become essential to carry out many activities in modern life. Energy is one of the important 
requirements that a country needs for its economic growth. At the same time, energy production 
has its impact on environment due to pollution and finally affects the quality of life of people.  
 
GROWING ENERGY NEEDS  
Energy plays a ke y role in the process of economic growth of a nation. The industrial 
development of any country is dependent on the organized  development of its power resources'.  
Energy is also indispensable for agriculture, transport, business and domestic requirements. In 
fact, electricity has such a wide range of applications in modern economic development that its 
per capita consumption is, to a great extent, an index of the material advancement of the country.  
Energy is the capacity for doing useful work. It is an ess ential input for economic growth. This 
energy is used in the form of electrical energy, thermal energy, light, mechanical energy and 
chemical energy etc.  
Energy is measured in joules in Si units. The annual per capita energy consumption in developed 
countr ies ranges from 5 to 11 kW whereas in the developing countries it is between 1 to 1.5 KW 
Only  20 
 Uses of Energy  
1. Energy is a primary input in any industrial operation.  
2. It is also a major input in sectors such as commerce, transport, tele -communications e tc. 
3. The wide range of services required in the household and industrial sectors.  
4. Owing to the far -reaching changes in the forms of energy and their respective roles in 
supporting human activities, research and training on various aspects of energy an d environment 
have assumed great significance.  
 
Types of energy: There are three main types of energy;  
A. Non-renewable  B. Renewable  C.Nuclear energy  
 
A. Non – renewable energy resources  
 
Fossil fuels : Fossil means the remains of an animal or a plant which have become hard and 
turned into rock. All these found in earth’s crusts which have  been formed in the past by the 
geological processes . Fossil fuels are solid coal (lignite), liquid ( crude oil / pet roleum) and gases 
(natural gas ).  
a)Coal : Huge quantity of plant materials buried under earths crust and altered by geological 
process and converted into carbon rich fuel. It is a non – renewable source becaus e it takes a very 
long period (million of years ) for its formation.  
Coal is extracted by the process of mining and involves accidents due to mine collapse, ground 
water pollution, accumulation of poisonous material, explosive gases etc cause diseases. CO2 
pollution leads to green house effect (global  warming).  
 
b) Crude  oil: It is obtained in the form of liquid . The crude oil is heated up to  600oC in the oil 
refinery and condense the vapours of hydro – carbons. Petrol another  petroleum products are 
refined fuels from crude oil.  Petroleum products are used in large quantities in the manufacture 
of detergents , plastics, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, synthetic rubber etc.. The transport  sector 
consumes about 40% of diesel; 25% in dustries and 19%household and rest 16% agriculture and 
other sectors. .  
 
c) Natural  Gas: Gas deposits are trapped from the sedimentary formations by means  drilling 
holes into the rock formations. While burning of natural gas, the  emission of CO2 is less an d 
thus reduces green house effect and global warming . A total of 734 billion cubic mts of gas is 
estimated as proven reserves . 
 
B. Renewable  energy  resources : Renewable energy systems use resources that are constantly 
replaced and are usually less polluting.  
Examples include hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal (energy from the heat inside the 
earth).  
1. Solar  energy : The energy which is derived from the sun  is known as solar energy. It can be 
used for direct heating or sun’s heat is converted into electricity. Photo voltaic cells convert 
direct solar energy into electricity.  21 
 A number of solar equipments have been developed to utilize sun rays to heat water, to cook 
food, to pump water and to run certain machines and used for street lighting, railway signals etc. 
But the maj or problem with solar energy is that during cloudy weather it is available in less 
quantity  than on sunny days.  
 
How Solar Power Works  
The sun's energy can be captured to generate electricity or heat through a system of panels or 
mirrors.  
• Solar, or photovoltaic, cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. Most photovoltaic cells 
are made primarily of silicon, the materia l used in computer semiconductor chips, and 
arranged on rectangular panels. When sunlight hits a cell, the energy knocks electrons free of 
their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material. The resulting DC (direct current) 
electricity is then sent t o a power inverter for conversion to AC (alternating current).  
• Solar thermal collectors use heat -absorbing panels and a series of attached circulation tubes 
to heat water or buildings.  
• Solar concentration systems use mirrors -- usually arranged in a series  of long, parabolic 
troughs, a large round dish, or a circle surrounding a "power tower" -- to focus the sun's 
reflected rays on a heat -collecting element. The concentrated sunlight heats water or a heat -
transferring fluid such as molten salt to generate s team, which is then used conventionally to 
spin turbines and generate electricity.  
• Passive solar design is the creative use of windows, skylights and sunrooms, building site and 
orientation, and thermal construction materials to heat and light buildings, o r to heat water, 
the natural way.  
2. Hydro -Power energy : Electrical power is generated by hydro -electric projects in which dams 
are constructed across the river. The kinetic energy of water is converted into mechanical energy 
by means of turbines and in tu rn, the mechanical energy is transferred into electrical energy by 
generators. Hydro power projects lead to several environmental problems like destruction of 
animal habitats, deforestation,  migration of people etc..  
 
3. Geothermal  energy : Geothermal energ y found within rock formations. Inside the earth the 
temperature rises with depth .The temperature in earth’s crust is around 4000o C. Geysers ( a 
natural spring that emits hot water ) and hot springs are examples for geothermal energy where 
the steam and hot water come to the surface, in areas where the steam is tapped by drilling. The 
obtained steam is then used to generate power. Air pollution results in case of geothermal energy 
where the gases like H 2S, NH 3, CO 2 present in the steam coming out of the geothermal sources. 
The overall efficiency for power production is low (15%) as compared to fossil fuels (40%).  
 
4. Wind  energy: Wind energy is the kinetic energy associated with the movement  of 
atmospheric air. Wind  mills convert the wind energy into electrical  energy. On an average wind 
mills can convert 30 – 40 % of available  wind energy into electrical energ y at a steady wind 
speed of 8.5 mts / sec. The efficiency of wind mill is increased with the speed of wind and length  
of rotor blade.  
The total wind energy potential in India’s estimate is 25,000 MW of this about6000 MW is 
located in Tamil Nadu; 5000 MW in Gujarat and contribute thestates of Andhra Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan forbalance quan tity. 22 
  
 
Merits & demerits of wind energy:  
 
1. It is a non – polluting and environment friendly source of energy.  
2. It is a renewable energy available at free of cost  
3. Power generation is cheaper with nil recurring expenses.  
4. Wind mills are suitable to erect at on shore, remote and rural areaswhere wind blows with 
required intensity.  
5. Favorable in geographic locations which are away from cities.  
6. Wind turbine design, manufacturing, installation is complex due tovarying atmospheric 
conditi ons. 
7. Wind power doesn’t suitable for large scale generation.  
 
5. Ocean  energy : Seas and oceans are large water bodies . Seas absorb  solar radiation  and large 
amounts of solar energy are  stored in the tides and waves of  the ocean. Ocean energy is non – 
polluting in nature and suitable at a few places  only. Energy from seas or oceans is obtained from 
the following:  
 
(1) Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion : The oceans collect and store huge quantities  of solar 
on the surface of the water while the temperature o f deepwater  is very low. Using this 
temperature difference it is possible to convert heat  into electricity.  
(2) Tidal energy : Tidal waves of the sea can be used to turn turbine and generate  electricity. 
Asia’s first tidal power plant of 800 - 1000 MW capacity is  proposed to be set up at Kandla in 
Gulf of Kutch.  
 
6. Bio  mass energy : Bio -mass is an organic material from living beings or its  residues. It is a 
renewable source of energy derived from the waste of various  human and natural activities. The 
bio-mass energy sources include Wood , animal manure, sugarcane waste, agriculture crops, 
house hold waste , roots of plants, garbage etc. The simplest way of using bio -mass  energy 
sources is to all ow them to dry out in the sun and burn them.  
 
7. Bio -gas: Bio -gas is a sustainable source of energy by virtue of its production  from available 
natural organic wastes of cattle dung, human excreta , poultry waste, plant leaves, paddy husk 
etc…. Bio -gas is a mixture of methane ( 68%), CO 2 (31%) and N 2 (1%). Methane gas ( CH 4) is 
produced by bio -gas plants and this gas is utilized as cooking gas whose calorific  value varies 
from 4400 – 6200 Kilo Calories / cum. Heat value of biogas can be improved by reducing its  
23 
 CO 2 content.Bio -gas production is carried out in an enclosed bio -gas plant made of  bricks or 
steel. A slurry of waste organic matter is fed into the plant through an  inlet and gas formed is 
tapped by an inverted drum. As gas is produced the  drum rises and the gas may be drawn 
through an outlet.Bio -gas is commonly produced from cattle dung in a bio gas plant known as  
Gobar Gas plant. Bio -gas is a clean, cheap fuel that can be used for lighting  purpose, lifting 
water through small pumps.  
 
C.Nuclear Energy or Atomic power:  It is the energy which is trapped inside the atom. It is 
non–renewable source of energy which is released during fission or fusion of certain radioactive  
elements. The most important advantage of atomic power is the production of an enormous 
amount of energy from a small quantity of radioactive  element. For eg: 1 kg of Uranium  
liberates energy equivalent to 30000 kgs of coal.  
Energy released during nuclear reaction (mass  – energy equation as per Albert Einstein’s 
formula E = mc2).  
Nuclear Energy is produced by two processes namely (1) Nuclear Fission and (2) Nuclear 
Fusion.  
Nuclear Fission : The nucleus in atoms is split by fast moving neutrons and in turn a tremendous 
amount of energy in the form of heat, light etc is released by a chain of reactions. Uranium is 
used as fuel. The energy released slowly in this process is utilized to generate electricity or else  
released suddenly all at once, results a tremendous explosion as in the case of Atom bomb.  
Nuclear Fusion : Nuclear energy ca n be generated by fusion process which  involves two 
hydrogen atoms combine to produce one helium atom.  
Eg: hydrogen bomb. The disposal of nuclear wastes during mining, fuel production and reactor 
operation for a long time period resulting in adverse effec ts on environment. Disposable of 
nuclear waste is a national and global problem.  
 
 
USE OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES  
Alternative energy  is any energy source that is an alternative to fossil fuel . These alternatives 
are intended to address concerns about such fossil fuels.  
The nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has changed considerably over time, 
as have controversies regarding energy use. Today, because of the variety of energy choices and 
differing goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as "alternative" is highly 
controversial.  
In a general sense, alternative  energy as it is currently conceived, is that which is produced or 
recovered  without the undesirable consequences inherent in fossil fuel  use, particularly high 
carbon dioxide  emissions, an important factor in global warming . Sometimes, this less 
comprehensive meaning of "alternative energy" excludes nuclear energy  
• Solar energy  is the generation of electricity from the sun. It is split up into two types, 
thermal and electric energy. These two subgroups mean that they heat up homes and 
generate electricity respectively.  
• Wind energy  is the generation of electricity from the wind.  
• Geothermal energy  is using hot water or steam from the Earth’s in terior for heating 
buildings or electricity generation.  24 
 • Biofuel  and Ethanol  are plant -derived substitutes of gasoline for po wering vehicles.  
• Nuclear binding energy  uses nuclear fission to create energy.  
• Hydrogen  is used as clean fue l for spaceships, and some cars  
 
CASE STUDIES  
• In 1981, a plane called ‘The Solar Challenger ‘flew  from Paris to England in 5 hours, 
20minutes. It had 16,000 solar cells  glued to the wings and tail of the plane  and they produced 
enough power  to drive a small electric motor and propeller. Since  1987, every three years there  is 
a World Solar challenge for solar operated  vehicles in Australia where the  vehicles cover 3000 
kms.  
 
• The world ’s first solar -powered hos pitals in Mali in Africa. Being situated at the  edge of the 
Sahara desert, Mali receives  a large amount of sunlight. Panel’s  of solar  cells supply the power 
needed to run  vital equipment and keep medical supplies  cool in refrigerators.  
 
 
• In recent years, the popularity of building integrated  photovoltaic’s  (BIPV’s) has grown  
considerably. In this application , PV devices are designed as part of building materials  (i.e. roofs 
and siding) both to  produce electricit y and reduce costs by  replacing the costs of normal 
construction materials . There are more than  3, 000  BIPV systems in Germany and Japan  has a 
program that will build 70,000BIPV buildings.  
 
1.8 LAND RESOURCES  
 
Land as a resource : Landforms such as hills, valleys, plains, river basins and wetlands include  
different resource generating areas that the people living in them depend on. Many traditional  
farming societies had ways of preserving areas from which they used resources.  If land is 
utilized car efully it can be considered a renewable resource.  The roots of trees and grasses bind 
the soil. If forests are depleted, or grasslands overgrazed,  the land becomes unproductive and 
wasteland is formed. Intensive irrigation leads to water logging and salin ization, on which crops 
cannot grow. Land is also converted into a non -renewable resource when highly toxic industrial 
and nuclear wastes are  dumped on it.  Land on earth is as finite as any of our other natural 
resources. While mankind has learnt to  adapt his lifestyle to various ecosystems world over, he 
cannot live comfortably for instance on  polar ice caps, on under the sea, or in space in the 
foreseeable future.  
 
LAND DEGRADATION AND CONTROL OF LAND DEGRADATION  
 
Land degradation can be defined as any change in the land that alter its conditions  or reduces its 
quality. Land degradation occurs due to both natural disasters  like volcanic eruptions, 
earthquakes, heavy rains, fire etc or human induced  activities. The other causes of land 
degradation con sist of wind blow, salinity  of water, water logging, soil acidity, loss of flora and 
fauna.  
Desertification is land degradation occurring in the arid, semi -arid regions of the  world. These 
dry lands cover about 40% of the earth’s surface and puts  at risk more than 1 billion people who 
are dependent on these lands for  survival.  25 
 Land clearing and deforestation; Mining activity in forest areas; urban conversion ; bringing more 
land under cultivation; soil pollution ; loss of organic  matter in the soil s; alkalinization of soils; 
salinity of water etc leads to  land degradation.  Severe land degradation affects in decreasing the 
mineral wealth and economic  development of nations.  
The methods that are followed for the prevention of land degradation are called soil  conservation 
methods. Some of the popular methods are;  
(a) Contour farming : The land is prepared with alternate furrows (a long narrow  cut in the  
Ground)  and ridges at the same level. The water is caught  and held in furrows  and stores which 
reduce s run off and erosion.  
(b) Mulching : Stems of maize, cotton, tobacco etc are used as a mulch (decay  of leaves)  to 
reduce  soil moisture, evaporation.  
(c) Crop rotation : Growing same crop year after year depletes the nutrients and  land becomes  
Unproductive . This is overcome by changing the crops and  cultivating legumes  (plants  like peas, 
beans)  after a regular crop.  
(d) Strip cropping : It consists of planting crops in rows or strips along contours  to check flow of 
water . 
 
 
LANDSLIDES AND MAN INDUCED LAND SLIDES  
 
Landslides always exist on this planet and the term land slide is used to describe a wide variety 
of process that result a downward movement of rocks under gravitational forces. In other words, 
mass movement of rocks, debris and soil down a slope o f land.  
Landslides are primarily associated with steep slopes. Surface run -off and changes in drainage 
also cause for landslides. Landslides can also be initiated by rainfall; earthquakes; volcanic 
activity, changes in groundwater movement or any combinati on these factors.  
Debris -flows can travel down a hillside of speeds up to  200 miles per hour (more commonly, 30 
– 50 miles per hour) depending on the slope angle, water content, and type of earth and debris in 
the flow.  
While landslides are a naturally occ urring environmental hazard they have recently increased in 
frequency in certain areas due to human activities.  
Building excavations  collapses in mining (e.g.:  coal mine) causes landslides. However, 
landslides can be triggered by the human beings by induc ed changes in the environment.  
Simply landslides can be explained in three ways:  
(a) Inherent of rocks (weakness in the structure of a rock )  
(b) Due to heavy seismic or volcanic activity and  
(c) Due to various environmental conditions.  
 
SOIL EROSION AND C AUSES FOR SOIL EROSION  
The top layer of the earth is called as soil. Soil erosion occurs due to deforestation, overgrazing, 
industrialization; desertification etc.  
a. Deforestation: Mining, industrial, urban development etc causes deforestation and leads to 
exposure of the land to wind and rains causing soil erosion. Cutting trees leads to deforestation 
which in turn loss of organic matter in the soils.  
b. Overgrazing : When sufficient amount of grass is available for the organisms u sually the 
entire land /area may be subjected to exhaust and the land is exposed without grass and 
ultimately the land expose to wind/rain causing soil erosion. .  26 
 c. Industrialization : Different processes carried out by industries and mining operations cau se 
soil pollution which leads to degradation of lan d 
 
 
DESERTIFICATION:  
 
Desertification is the process which turns productive into non - productive desert as a result of 
poor land -management. Desertification occurs mainly in semi -arid areas (average annual rainfall 
less than 600 mm) bordering on deserts. In the Sahel, (the semi -arid area south of the Sahara 
Desert), for example, the desert moved 100 km southwards between 1950 and 1975.  
 
CAUSES OF DESERTIFICATION  
* Overgrazing is the major cau se of desertification worldwide. Plants of semi -arid areas are 
adapted to being eaten by sparsely scattered, large, grazing mammals which move in response to 
the patchy rainfall common to these regions. Early human pastoralists living in semi -arid areas 
copied this natural system. They moved their small groups of domestic animals in response to 
food and water availability. Such regular stock movement prevented overgrazing of the fragile 
plant cover.  
* Cultivation of marginal lands, i.e lands on which there  is a high risk of crop failure and a very 
low economic return, for example, some parts of South Africa where maize is grown.  
* Destruction of vegetation in arid regions, often for fuelwood.  
* Poor grazing management after accidental burning of semi -arid vegetation.  
* Incorrect irrigation practices in arid areas can cause salinization, (the buildup  of salts in the 
soil) which can prevent plant growth.  
When the practices described above coincide with drought, the rate of desertification increases 
dramatic ally.  
Increasing human population and poverty contribute to desertification as poor people may be 
forced to overuse their environment in the short term, without the ability to plan for the long term 
effects of their actions. Where livestock has a social i mportance beyond food, people might be 
reluctant to reduce their stock numbers.  
EFFECTS OF DESERTIFICATION  
Desertification reduces the ability of land to support life, affecting wild species, domestic 
animals, agricultural crops and people. The reduction in plant cover that accompanies 
desertification leads to accelerated soil erosion by wind and water. South A frica losing 
approximately 300 -400 million tonnes of topsoil every year. As vegetation cover and soil layer 
are reduced, rain drop impact and run -off increases.  27 
 Water is lost off the land instead of soaking into the soil to provide moisture for plants. Ev en 
long-lived plants that would normally survive droughts die. A reduction in plant cover also 
results in a reduction in the quantity of humus and plant nutrients in the soil, and plant 
production drops further. As protective plant cover disappears, floods  become more frequent and 
more severe. Desertification is self -reinforcing, i.e. once the process has started, and conditions  
are set for continual deterioration.  
1.8.1 ROLE OF AN INDIVIDUALCONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES  
 
Different natural resources like forests, water, soil, food, mineral and energy resources  play a 
vital role in the development of a nation. With our small individual  efforts we can together help 
in conserving our natural resources to a large  extent. Following are the ways:  
a) Conserve Water:  
1. Don’t keep water taps running while brushing, shaving, washing or bathing.  
2. In washing machines fill the machine only to th e level required for your clothes.  
3. Install water saving toilets that use not more than 6 liters per flush.  
4. Check for water leaks in pipes and toilets and repair them promptly.   
5. Reuse the soapy water of washing from clothes for gardening, driveways  etc. 
6. Water the plants and the lawns in the evening when evaporation losses are  minimum.  
Never water the plants in mid -day. 
7. Install a system to capture rain water.  
b) Conserve energy:  
1. Turn off lights fans and other appliances when not in use.  
2. Obtain as much heat as possible from natural sources. Dry the clothes in sun instead   
of direr if possible.  
3. Use solar cooker for cooking which will be more nutritious and will save your  LPG  
Expenses . 
4. Build your house with provision for sunspace which will keep your house warmer  and  
will provide more light.  
5. Drive less, make fewer trips and use public t ransportations whenever possible.Share  
a car -pool if possible.  
6. Control the use of A.C.  
7. Recycle and reuse glass, metals and papers.  
8. Use bicycle or just walk down small distances instead of using vehicle.  
Protect the Soil:  
1. Grow different types of ornamental plants, herbs and trees in your garden. Grow  grass  
in the open areas which will bind the soil and prevent its erosion.  
2. Make compost from your kitchen waste and use it for your kitchen -garden.  
3. Do not irrigate the  plants using a strong flow of water as it would wash off the soil . 
4. Better use sprinkling irrigation.  
Promote Sustainable Agriculture:  
1. Do not waste food; Take as much as you can eat.  
2. Reduce the use of pesticides.  
3. Fertilize your crop with organic fertilizers.  
4. Use drip irrigation.  
5. Eat local and seasonal vegetables.  
6. Control pest  28 
  
UNIT -II  
ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY  
2.1 ECOSYSTEM  
An ecosystem is a community of organisms that interact with each other and non living 
components for sustainable development and adaptation to changing conditions. There are 
different type of ecosystems around us which involves living organisms and non living 
organisms . If we combine all the ecosystems present on earth, it is called Biosphere . The term 
ecosystem was first proposed by A.G.Tansley (1935) who defined ecosystem as follows: 
“Ecosystem is defined as a self -sustained community of  plants and animals existing in  its own 
environment.”Odum (1971) defined ecosystem as any unit that includes all the organisms in a 
given area interacting with the physical environment, so that a flow of energy give rise to a 
clearly defined tropic structure, biotic diversity and materi al cycles within  the system ”Michael 
Allaby (1983) defined ecosystem as a community of interdependent organisms together with the 
environment  
 
CONCEPT OF ECOSYSTEM:  
In an ecosystem, the interaction of life with its environment takes place at many levels. A  single 
bacteria in the soil interacts with water, air around it within a small space while a fish in a river 
interacts with water and other animals, rivals in a large space. .  
Considering the operational point of view; the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem are 
so interlinked such that their separation from each other is practically difficult. So, in an 
ecosystem both organisms (biotic communities) and abiotic environment (rainfall, temperature, 
humidity) each influence the properti es with other for maintenance of life.  
 
STRUCTURE OF ECOSYSTEM  
 
A structure of Ecosystem comprise of  
•The Composition of biological community including, species number, biomass, life history, and  
distribution in space.  
•The quantity and distribution of non-living material, such as nutrient water, etc.  
•The rage of condition of existence such as temperature, light.  
 
FUNCTION OF ECOSYSTEM : 
 
•The rate of biological energy flow i.e. production & respiration rates of the community.  
•The rate of material or nutrient cycles  
•Biological or ecological regulation including both regulation of organism by environment and 
regulation of environment by the organisms.  
 
2.1.1 COMPONENTS OF AN ECOSYSTEM:  
 
There are two components of an ecosystem; Living components and non living components.  29 
 Non Living Components : (Abiotic ) Non living components are the physical and chemical 
factors that directly or indirectly affect the living components e.g. air, water, land, rock etc. Non 
living components are also call ed Abiotic components.  
Physical factors include sunlight, water, fire, soil, air, temperature etc.  
Chemical factors include moisture, salinity of water, soil nutrients, oxygen dissolved in water 
etc. 
Living Components : Living components in an ecosystem are  either producers or consumers. 
They are also called biotic components. Producers can produce organic components e.g. plants 
can produce starch, carbohydrates, cellulose from a process called photosynthesis. Consumers 
are the components that are dependent on producers for their food e.g. human beings and 
animals • 
 Biotic Components are further classified into 3 main groups  
•Producers  •Consumers  •Decomposers or Reducers  
1. Producer ( Autotrophs): The green plants have chlorophyll with the help of which they 
trap solar energy and change it into chemical energy of carbohydrates using simple 
inorganic compound namely, water and carbon dioxide. This process is known as 
photosynthesis. The chemical energy stored by the producers is utilized partly by the 
producers for their own growth and survival and the remaining is stored in the plants for 
their future use. They are classified into two categories based on their source of food.  
a)Photoautotrophs:  An organism capable of synthesizing its own food from inorgani c 
substances using light as an energy source. Green plants and photosynthetic bacteria are 
photoautotrophs.  
b)Chemotrophs:  Organisms that obtain energy  by the oxidation  of electron donors  in 
their environments. These molecules can be organic  (chemoorganotrophs ) or inorganic  
(chemolithotrophs ). 
2. Consumers ( Heterotrophs): The animals lack chlorophyll and are unable to synthesis 
their own food therefore they depend on the producers for their food. •They are known as 
heterotrophs (i.e. heteros= others, trophs= feeder).The Consumers are of 4 types:  
(a) Primary Consumer: ( Herbivo res) i.e. Animal feeding on plants, e.g. Rabbit, deer,      
goat etc.  
(b) Secondary Consumers: The animal feeding on Herbivores are called as secondary  
Consumer or primary carnivores. e.g. Cats, foxes, snakes.  
(c) Tertiary Consumers: These are large carnivo res which feed on secondary 
consumers. e.g. Wolves  
(d) Quaternary Consumers: They are also called omnivores these are largest carnivores   
                                                   Which feed on tertiary consumers and are not eaten up by   
                                                   any other animals. e.g. lion and Tiger.  
 
3. Decomposers or Detrivores: Bacteria & fungi belong to this category. They break down 
the dead organic matter of producers & consumers for their food and release to the 
environment the simple inorganic and organic substance. These simple substances are 
reused by the producers resulting in a cyclic exchange of material between biotic & 
abiotic environment.  
Eg: Bacteria, Earth worms, Beetles etc  
 30 
 2.1.2  ENERGY FLOW IN AN ECOSYSTEM  
 •Biological activities require energy which ultimately comes from the sun. Solar energy is 
transformed into chemical energy by a process of photosynthesis this energy is stored in plant 
tissue and then transformed into heat energy during metabolic activit ies.  
•Thus in biological world the energy flows from the sun to plants and then to all heterotrophic 
organisms. The flow of energy is unidirectional and non -cyclic.  
This one way flow of energy is governed by laws of thermodynamics which states that:  
(a) Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but may be transformed from one form  
to another  
      (b) During the energy transfer there is degradation of energy from a concentrated form 
(mechanical, chemical, or electrical etc.) to a dispersed form (heat).  
No energy transformation is 100 % efficient;  it is always accompanied by some 
dispersion or loss of energy in the form heat. Therefore, biological systems including ecosystems  
must be supplied with energy on a continuous Basis.  
 
MODELS OF ENERGY FLOW IN ECOSYSTEM  
1. Single Channel Energy Flow Model: The flow of energy takes place in a unidirectional 
manner through a single channel of producers to herbivores and carnivores. The energy captured 
by autotrophs does not revert back to solar input but passes to  herbivores; and that which passes 
to herbivores does not go back to autotrophs but passes to consumers. Due to one way flow of 
energy, the entire system would collapse if primary source of energy were cut off. At each tropic 
level there occurs progressive  decrease in energy which is mainly due to loss of energy as heat in 
metabolic reactions and also some of the energy is utilized at each tropic level  
31 
  
2. Y- shaped model: shows  a common boundary, light and heat flow as well as import,  export 
and storage of organic matter . Decomposers are placed in separate box to partially separate the 
grazing and detritus food chains. In terms of energy levels decomposers are in fact a mixed 
group. •Y - shaped energy flow is more realistic and practic al than the single channel energy flow 
model because: •It conforms to the basic stratified structure of ecosystems •It separates the two 
chains i.e. grazing & detritus food chain in both time and space. •Micro consumers (bacteria  & 
fungi) and the macro con sumers (animals) differ greatly in size - metabolism relations in two 
models.  
 
 
3.Universal energy flow model  :As the flow of energy takes place, there is gradual loss of 
energy at each level there by resulting in less energy available at the next tropic l evel as 
indicated by narrower pipes (energy flow) and smaller boxes (stored energy in biomass). The 
loss of energy is mainly the energy which is not utilized (U). This is the energy loss in 
locomotion, excretion etc. or it the energy lost in respiration (C R) which is for maintenance. The 
remaining energy is used for production (P).  
 
32 
  
 
 
 
2.1.3  ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION  
Ecological Succession  is the phenomenon or process by which a community progressively 
transforms itself until a stable community is formed. It is a fundamental concept in ecology , 
refers to more or less predicta ble and orderly changes in the composition or structure of an 
ecological community . Succession may be initiated either by formation of new, unoccupied 
habitat ( e.g., a lava flow  or a severe landslide ) or by some form of disturbance  (e.g. fire, severe 
wind throw  , logging ) of an existing community. Succession that begins in  areas where no soil is 
initially present is called primary succession , whereas succession that begins in areas where soil 
is already present is called secondary succession . 
Clement's theory of succession/Mechanisms of succession  
F.E. Clement (1916) developed a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general 
ecological concept. His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. 
Clement's concept is usually termed classical ecological theory . According to Clement, 
succession is a process involving several phases:  
1. Nudation : Succession begins w ith the development of a bare site, called Nudation 
(disturbance).  
2. Migration : It refers to arrival of propagules.  
3. Ecesis : It involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.  
4. Competition : As vegetation became well established, grew, and spread, vari ous species 
began to compete for space, light and nutrients. This phase is called competition.  
5. Reaction : During this phase autogenic changes affect the habitat resulting in 
replacement of one plant community by another.  
6. Stabilization:  Reaction phase leads to development of a climax community.  
33 
  
Seral communities:  
A seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards 
its climax community . In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax 
conditions are attained. A prisere  is a collection of seres making up the development of 
an area from non -vegetated surfaces to  a climax community. Depending on the 
substratum and climate, a seral community can be one of the following:  
Hydrosere  : Community in freshwater  
Lithosere   : Community  on rock  
Psammosere     : Community  on sand  
Xerosere  : Community in dry area  
Halosere  : Community in saline body (e.g. a marsh)  
 
Climax community  
The final or stable community in a sere is the  climax community  or climatic vegetation . It is self -
perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of 
organic matter in a climax community mostly. The annual production and use of e nergy is 
balanced in such a community.  
 
2.1.4  FOOD CHAIN, FOOD WEB & ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS:  
FOOD CHAIN:  
In food chain each organism eats the smaller organisms and is eaten by the larger one. All those 
organisms which are interlinked with each other through food to gather constitute the ecosystem. 
•The different levels in a food chain are called tropic levels, Each food chain has three main 
tropic levels: - Producer level, Consume r level, and decomposer level. If any of the intermediate 
stage of the fo od chain is removed, the succeeding links of the food chain will be affected.  
 
 
Types of Food Chains : 
a) Grazing Food Chain: This type of food chain starts from living green plants goes to 
grazing herbivores and onto carnivores. Ecosystem with such type of food chain directly 
34 
 depends upon the solar energy for their food requirements. Most of the ecosystem in 
nature follows  this type of food chain.  
b) Detritus food Chain: This type of food chain goes from dead organic matter onto 
microorganisms and then to the organisms feeding on detritus and their predators. Such 
ecosystems are  less dependent on direct solar energy.  
c) Parasit ic Food Chain: This type of food chain starts from big hosts and ends with 
parasitic organisms  
FOOD WEB :  
The interconnected, interlocking pattern of food chain is known as food web. •Under natural 
condition of the linear arrangement of food chain hardly o ccurs and they remain interconnected 
with each other through different types of organisms at different levels Such a interconnected 
and interlocking pattern of food chain is known as food web..  
 
ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS  
The different species in a food chain ar e called tropic levels. Each food chain has 3 main trophic 
level, producer, consumer, and decomposers. •Thus Graphical representation of these trophic 
levels is called as Ecological Pyramids. It was devised by an ecologist “Charles Elton ” therefore 
this pyramid are also called Ecological pyramid or Eltonian pyramids . 
Types of Ecological Pyramids : 
Ecological pyramids are of three types:     I 
I) Pyramid of Number                           II)Pyramid of biomass                              
III)Pyramid of Energy  
35 
 I) Pyramid of Number : 
 
•They show the relationship between producers, herbivores, and carnivores at successive tropic 
levels in terms of their number.  
 •In case of pond  ecosystem the producers are mainly phytoplankton and are always maximum 
in number this number then shows a decrease towards apex as primary consumers are 
zooplanktons are lesser in number than phytoplankton, the secondary consumers are large fish 
are even lesser in number than the phytoplankton. Thus the shape of pyram id is upright. But in 
case of forest ecosystem the pyramids is always inverted because the producers are mainly large 
trees, are lesser in numbers, the herbivores fruit eating birds are more in number than the 
producers, then there is gradual decrease in n umber of secondary consumers thus making 
pyramid upright again. Thus the pyramid of number does not give a true picture of the food chain 
and are not very functional.  
 
II) Pyramid of Biomass : 
•The pyramid of biomass represents the relationship between different tropic levels in terms of 
biomass. •There is generally gradual decrease in biomass of organisms at successive levels from 
the producers to the top carnivores. Thus pyramid of biomass i s upright for grassland ecosystem.  
•However in case of a pond as the producers are algae, are least in number and this value 
gradually shows an increase towards the apex of pyramid thus making the pyramid inverted in 
shape.  
 
36 
  
III) Pyramid of energy : 
 •Of the 3 types of ecological pyramid the energy pyramid gives the best picture of overall nature 
of the ecosystem. In this type of pyramid the tropic level is decided depending upon the rate at 
which food is being produced.  
 •In shape it is alway s upright as in most of the cases there is always gradual decrease in the 
energy content at successive trophic level from producers to various consumers.  
 
 
2.1.4 CLASSIFICATION  OF ECOSYSTEMS  
Due to the abiotic factors, different ecosystems develop in dif ferent ways. These factors and their 
interaction between each other and with biotic components have resulted in formation of 
different types of ecosystems as explained below.  
Ecosystem may be natural or artificial.  
Artificial Ecosystem: These are maintained or created artificially by man. The man tries to 
control biotic community as well as physico -chemical environment.  
Eg: Artificial pond, urban area development.  
Natural Ecosystem: It consists of Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems which are mainta ined 
naturally.  
37 
  
 
Different types of ecosystem of biosphere artificially categorized as follows:  
I) Natural Ecosystems:  These ecosystems operate by themselves under natural conditions 
without any major interference by man. Based upon the particular kind of habitat, these are 
further divided as: •Terrestrial as forest, grassland, desert etc.  
•Aquatic which may be further d istinguished as  
•Freshwater which may be lotic (running water as springs, stream, river) or lentic (standing water 
as  
   lake, pond, pools, ditch, swamps, etc.)  
•Marine Ecosystems: as an ocean or shallow ones like sea or estuary etc.  
II) Artificial Ecos ystems: These are maintained by man where, by addition of energy & planned 
manipulations natural balance is disturbed regularly.  
For eg : croplands like maize, wheat, rice -fields etc., where man tries to control the biotic 
community as well as physico -chem ical environment are artificial ecosystems  
 
Pond Ecosystem : A Pond as a whole serves a good example of freshwater ecosystem  
•Abiotic Components : The chief components are heat, light, pH of water, CO2, oxygen, 
calcium, nitrogen, phosphates, etc.  
•Biotic Components : The various organization that constitute the biotic component are as 
follows,  
•Producers: These are green plants, and some photosynt hetic bacteria. The producer fix radiant 
energy and  convert it into organic substances as carbohydrates, protein etc  
•Macrophytes: these are large rooted plants, which include partly or completely 
submerged hydrophytes, eg  Hydrilla, Trapha, Typha.  
•Phyto plankton: These are minute floating or submerged lower plants eg algae. 
•Consumers: They are heterotrophs which depend for their nutrition on the organic food 
manufactured by producers. • Primary Consumers : – Benthos : These are animals 
associated with livin g plants ,detrivores and some other microorganisms –Zooplanktons: 
38 
 These are chiefly rotifers, protozoans, they feed on phytoplankton • Secondary 
Consumers: They are the Carnivores which feed on herbivores, these are chiefly insect 
and fish, most insects & w ater beetles, they feed on zooplanktons. • Tertiary 
Consumers: These are some large fish as game fish, turtles, which feed on small fish and 
thus become tertiary consumers. • Decomposers: They are also known as micro -
consumers. They decompose dead organic ma tter of both producers and animal to simple 
form. Thus they play an important role in the return of minerals again to the pond 
ecosystem, they are chiefly bacteria, & fungi.  
 
Ocean Ecosystem  
are more stable than pond ecosystem, they occupy 70 % of the ea rth surface.  
•Abiotic Components: Dissolved oxygen, light, temperature, minerals. •Biotic Components:  
•Producers: These are autotrophs and are also known Primary producers. They are mainly, some 
microscopic algae (phyto -planlanktons) besides them there a re mainly, seaweeds, as brown and 
red algae also contribute to primary production. • Consumers: They are all heterotrophic macro 
consumers • Primary Consumer: The herbivores, that feed on producers are shrimps, Molluscs, 
fish, etc. • Secondary Consumers: Thes e are carnivores fish as Herring, Shad, Mackerel, feeding 
on herbivores. • Tertiary Consumers: These includes, other carnivores fishes like, COD, 
Halibut, Sea Turtle, Sharks etc.  
•Decomposers: The microbes active in the decay of dead organic matter of prod ucers, and 
animals are chiefly, bacteria and some fungi.  
 
Estuarine Ecosystem  
•An estuary is a partially enclosed body of water along the coast where fresh water from river 
and streams meet and mix with salt water from oceans. These Ecosystems  are considered as most 
39 
 fertile ecosystem. • Abiotic Components : Nutrients such as phosphoru s and nitrogen, 
temperature, light, salinity, pH. •This ecosystem experience wide daily and seasonal fluctuations 
in temperature and Salinity level because of variation in freshwater in flow. • Biotic 
Components: •Producers: Phyplanktons - these micro -organi sms manufacture food by 
photosynthesis and absorb nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen, besides them, mangroves, 
sea grass, weeds, and salt marshes. • Consumers: Primary consumers , Zooplanktons that feed 
on Phytoplankton, besides them some small micro organisms that feed on producers. • Secondary 
Consumer: Include worms, shellfish, small fish, feeding on Zooplanktons • Tertiary 
Consumer:  Fishes, turtles, crabs, starfishes feeding on secondary consumers. • Decomposers: 
Fungi & Bacteria are the chief microbes active in decay of dead organic matter.  
 
River  Ecosystem  
•As Compared with lentic freshwater (Ponds & lakes), lotic waters such as s treams, and river 
have been less studied. However, the various components of an riverine and stream ecosystem 
can be arranged as follows. • Producers: The chief producers that remain permanently attached 
to a firm substratum are green algae as Cladophora, a nd aquatic mosses. • Consumers: The 
consumers show certain features as permanent attachment to firm substrata, presence of hooks & 
suckers, sticky undersurface, streamline bodies, flattened bodies.. Thus a variety of animal are 
found, which are fresh spongy  and caddis -fly larvae, snails, flat worms etc. • Decomposers: 
Various bacteria and fungi like actinomycetes are present which acts as decompose  
 
2.2 BIODIVERSITY  
The word biodiversity is a combination of two words: “ biological and diversity” and refers to the 
variety of life on the Earth.  Biodiversity  is the degree of variation of life forms within a given 
species , ecosystem , biome , or an entire planet . Biodiversity is a measure of the health of 
ecosystems . 
The term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond  
F. Dasmann in the 1968.  
The term's contracted fo rm biodiversity  may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985  
 
Biodiversity is usually considered at three different levels:  
The following are different types of biodiversity  
40 
 1. Genetic diversity: variety in the genetic makeup among individuals within a species  
2. Species diversity: variety among the species or distinct types of living organisms found in 
different habitats of the planet  
3. Ecosystem or ecological diversity: variety of forests, deserts, grasslands, streams, lakes,                                                        
oceans, coral reefs , wetlands and other biological communities  
4. Functional diversity: biological and chemical processes of functions such as energy flow an 
matter cycling needed for the survival of species and biological  communities  
 
1. Genetic Diversity : Genetic diversity is the “raw material” that permits species to adjust to a 
changing world whether  these changes are due to natural factors or are caused by human factors. 
It refers to the variation at the leve l of individual genes and provides a mechanism for 
populations to adapt to their ever -changing environment.  
Eg: Human beings  
 
2. Species Diversity : Species diversity refers to the different types of living organisms on Earth. 
This includes the many types of birds, insects, plants, bacteria, fungi, mammals, and more. Many 
differing species often live together in communities depending on each other to provide their 
needs.  
A species can be defined as a group or population of similar organisms that reproduce by 
interbreeding within the group. Members of a species do not normally reproduce with members 
of any other species. Members of a specific species possess common characteristics that 
distinguish them from other species and this remains constant regardless of geographic location.  
 
3. Ecosystem Diversity : Ecological diversity or ecosystem diversity is the variety of biological 
communities, such as forests, deserts, grasslands and streams that interact with one another and 
with their physical and chemical (no nliving) environments. It relates to the different forms of life 
which are present in any one particular area or site, in more precise terms, it concerns the 
different species of a particular genus which are present in an ecological community.  
 
   2.2.1 VALUES OF BIODIVERSITY  
 
The value of biodiversity (in terms of its commercial utility, ecological services, social and 
aesthetic values) is enormous. There are several ways that biodiversity and its various forms are  
Valuable to humans. The biodiv ersity value may be classified as follows:  
 
1. CONSUMPTIVE VALUE: Biodiversity is an essential requirement for the maintenance of 
global food supply. The main sources of human food include animals, fish and plant produces.  
A large number of plants are cons umed by human beings as food. A few animal species are 
consumed by people which come  from cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, buffaloes, chickens, ducks, 
geese and turkey species.  
Fish: Many fresh water fish can be grown in ponds. Israel and China already get abou t half of 
their fish from aqua culture.  
Drugs & medicines : About 75% of the world’s population depends upon plants or plant extracts 
for medicines. The drug Penicillin used as an antibiotic is derived from a fungus called 
Penicillium. Likewise, Tetracyclin e from bacteria  which is used to cure malaria is obtained from 
the bark of cinchona tree. .  
Fuel: The fossil fuels like coal, petroleum products and natural gas are the products of 
biodiversity.  41 
  
2. PRODUCTIVE VALUE: Some of the organisms are commercially usable where the product 
is marketed and sold. The animal products like tusks of elephants; musk from deer; silk from 
silkworm; wool from sheep or goats; fur of many animals etc all of which are traded in the 
market.  
        Eg: Calabar bean was tradionally used as a poison in West Africa . 
  Daisy plants were first used as a lice remedy in the Middle East  and this led to the     
 Discovery  of Pyrethrum . Mosquito coils made from Pyrethrum are sold in the market.  
 The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces toxic proteins that kill certain insects.  
 
3. SOCIAL VALUE : These are the values associated with the social life, religion and spiritual 
aspects of the people. Many of the plants are considered to be sacred in our country like Tulasi, 
Mango leaves, Banana leaves . The leaves, fruits, flowers of some of the plants are used in 
worship. Many animals like cow, snake, bull, peacock also have significant place in spiritual and 
thus hold special importance. Thus, biodi versity has distinct social value, attached with different 
societies.  
4. ETHICAL VALUE : The ethical value means that human beings may or may not use a certain 
species but knowing the very fact that this species exists in nature gives pleasure.  
For eg: A p eculiar species of Pigeon, grey / white bird with short legs is no more on this earth. 
Similarly, Dodo species is also no more. Human beings are not deriving anything direct from 
Kangaroo, giraffe but strongly feel that these species should exist in nature . 
 
5. AESTHETIC VALUE : Every one of us would like to visit vast stretches of lands to enjoy the 
visible life. People from farther areas, spend a lot of time and money to visit wild life areas 
where they can enjoy the aesthetic value of biodiversity and thi s type of tourism is known as eco 
tourism.  
Eco-tourism is estimated to generate 12 billion dollars of revenue annually that roughly gives the 
aesthetic value of biodiversity.  
A study of the impact of environment on the psyche was undertaken by Kaplan and K aplan 
(1989) in which they found that being near nature relieved working stresses while people who 
worked in closed environment or human made structures experienced much more job stresses 
and illnesses.  
 
2.2.2 BIODIVERSITY AT GLOBAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEV EL 
The enormous diversity of life forms in the biosphere has evolved essentially through the process 
of trial and error during course of organic evolution. The changes in character of living organism 
which confer some advantage to the species are retained.  
The changes in climatic conditions are reflected in the distribution of living organism and the 
pattern of biodiversity on our planet. The number of species present per unit area decreases as we 
move from mild tropics to the tundra's.  
The Indian region (8° to 30° N and 60° to 97.5°) with total area of 329 million hectares is very 
rich in biodiversity. It is estimated that about 4500 species of plants occur in this country. The 
position of Indian sub -continent at the confluence of there biogeograph y reels is also an 
important contributing factor and explain the preserve of African, European, Sind, Japanese and 
Indo-Malayan elements in the flora and fauna in India. It is the sum total of such remarkable 42 
 diversity that has made India a "gene bank" for  a number of food crops, forest trees, medical and 
aromatic plants and domesticated animal.  
Forests are important bioreserves; most of the 1700 million hectares of tropical forests are 
located in poor countries. The forests surrounding Reo de Aneroid are p art of vegetation which is 
rich in species of plants and animals that are endemic. There are about 53.5% of trees species 
found only in these forests and studies of birds, reptiles, primates and butter flies have revealed 
equally high or higher endemics.  
2.2.3 INDIA AS A MEGA DIVERSITY NATION  
 
India contains a great wealth of biodiversity in the forests, wet lands and marine areas. Hence 
biodiversity can be observed at all levels ie locally, nationally and globally . India, as a 
subcontinent representing a  major part of South Asia is rich in flora and fauna and hence it is one 
of the world’s “MEGADIVERSITY NATIONS” .  
It is estimated that over 75000 species of animals and over 45000 species of plants are found in 
India.  
 
Biogeographic regions of India: Accor ding to wild life Institute of India , the country has 10 
distinct biogeographic zones or regions. They are:  
1. Trans – Himalayan Zone  
2. Himalayan Zone  
3. Desert Zone  
4. Semi – arid Zone  
5. Western Ghats  
6. Deccan Zone  
7. Gangetic plain Zone  
8. NE Indian Zone  
9. Coastal Zone  
10. Islands around the country  
 
2.2.4 HOT SPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY  
 
Areas which exhibit high species richness as well as high species endemism are termed as hot 
spots of biodiversity. Species which are restricted only to particular  areas are known as endemic. 
India shows a good number of endemic species. About 62% of amphi bians and 50% of lizards 
are endemic to India. Western Ghats are the site of maximum endemism. The term “Hot spots” 
was introduced by Myers (1988). There are 25 such hot spots of biodiversity on a global level 
out of which two are present in India, namely the Eastern Himalayas and Western Ghats. These 
hotspots covering less than 2% of the world’s land area are found to have about 50% of the 
terrestrial biodiversity. According to Myers an area is designated as a hotspot when it contains at 
least 0.5% of the plant species as endemics.  
 
a) Eastern Himalayas:  They display an ultra -varies topography that fosters species diversity 
and endemism. Recent studies have shown that North East India along with its contiguous 
regions of Burma and Chinese provinces of Yunna n and Schezwan is an active center of organic 
evolution and is considered to be the cradle of flowering plants. Out of the world’s recorded flora 
30% are endemic to India of which 35000 are in the Himalayas.  43 
  
 b) Western Ghats:  It extends along a 17000 km²  strip of forests in Maharashtra, Karnataka, 
Tamilnadu and Kerala and has 40% of the total endemic plant species. The major centers of 
diversity are Agastyamalai Hills and Silent valley - the new Amambalam Reserve Basin .It is 
reported that only 6.8% of the  original forests are existing today while the rest has been 
deforested or degraded, which raises a serious cause of  alarm, because it means we have already 
lost a huge proportion of the biodiversity.  
 
 
2.2.5 THREATS TO  BIODIVERSITY  
 
Extinction or elimination of a species is a natural process of evolution. In the geologic period the 
earth has experienced mass extinctions. During evolution, species have died out and have been 
replaced by others. However, the rate of  loss of species in g eologic past has been a slow process, 
keeping in view the vast span of time going back to 444 million years. The process of extinction 
has become particularly fast in the recent years of civilization. Edward O. Wilson  prefers the 
acronym  HIPPO, standing for habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, human 
overpopulation, and over -harvesting  
Following ar e the major causes and issues related to threats to biodiversity:  
1. Habitat destruction: Habitat  destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially 
related to tropical forest  destruction . Factors contributing to habitat loss are: overpopulation , 
deforestati on, pollution  (air pollution , water pollution , soil contamination ) and global warming  or 
climate change.  
Habitat s ize and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and 
those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat 
area. Conversion to "trivial" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture  following deforestation ) 
effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the co nversion. In some 
countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to 
biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community)  
 
2. Poaching:  Illegal trade of wildlife products by killing prohibited endangered animals i.e. 
poaching is another threat to wildlife. Despite international ban on trade in products from 
endangered species, smuggling of wildlife items like furs, hides, horns, tusks, li ve specimens and 
herbal products worth millions of dollars per year continues, the developing nations in Asia, 
Latin America and Africa are the richest source of biodiversity and have enormous wealth of 
wildlife. The rich countries in Europe and North Amer ica and some affluent countries in Asia 
like Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong are the major importers of the wildlife products or  wildlife 
itself. The trading of such wild life products is highly profit making for the poachers who  just 
hunt these prohibited wil d lives and smuggle it to other countries mediated through mafia. The 
worst part is that for every live animal that actually gets into the market about 50 additional 
animals are caught and killed  
If you are fond of rare plants, fish or birds, please make s ure that you are not going to the 
endangered species or wild -caught species. Doing so will help in checking further decline of 
these species. Also do not purchase fur coat, purse or  bag, or items made of crocodile skin or 
python skin. You will certainly he lp in preserving biodiversity by doing so.  44 
  
 
3. Man -Wildlife Conflicts: We have discussed about the need to preserve and protect wildlife. 
However, sometimes we come across conflicting situations when wildlife starts causing immense 
damage and danger to ma n and under such conditions it becomes very difficult for the forest 
department to pacify the affected villages and gain local support for wildlife conservation. 
Instances of man animal conflicts keep on coming to lime light from several states in our 
coun try. 
 In Sambalpur, Orissa 195 humans were killed in the last 5years by elephants. In retaliation the 
villagers killed 95 elephants in the border  region of Kote -Chamarajanagar belt in Mysore have 
been reported recently. The man -elephant conflict in this re gion has arisen because of massive 
damage done by the elephants to the farmer’s cotton and sugarcane crops. The agonized villagers 
electrocute the elephants and sometimes hide explosives in the sugarcane fields, which explode 
as the elephants intrude into their fields. In fact, more killings are done by locals than by 
poachers.  
 
Causes of Man -animal conflicts:  
Dwindling habitats of tigers, elephants, rhinos and bears due to shrinking forests cover are 
compelled to move outside the forests and attack the fi eld or  sometimes even humans. Human 
encroachment into the forest areas has rendered all forest living animals to trespass the borders 
of human civilizations. This is because the conflicts between man and the wildlife have increased 
since it is an issue of survival of both  
3.1 Invasive Non -Native Species : Species that are non -native to a particular area can sometimes 
spread very quickly, for example the zebra mussel and Japanese knotweed have spread rapidly in 
Ireland in the past two decades. As a result, th ese species can destabilize an ecosystem by 
altering habitats affecting food webs.  
3.2 Pollution/Litter : As you will remember from the Litter and Waste theme, pollution is always 
caused by humans. Pollution can have a huge impact, altering the balance with in ecosystems, 
and is the cause of death for millions of animals and plants around the world every year.  
3.3 Land Use Change/Increased Infrastructure Development : This is the alteration of natural 
areas by humans, for example, the clearing of huge areas of  rainforest in South America for 
farming. In Ireland, upland open habitats, such as rough grassland, scrub and heath, have been 
changed by agriculture and afforestation.  
3.4 Intensive Farming Practices : Extensive use and concentrations of chemical and/or 
biological pesticides and the removal of hedgerows are typical practices in modern -day intensive 
farming. Often large areas of land are planted with a single crop (monocultures) which greatly 
reduces the level of biodiversity in that area.  
3.5 Climate Chang e: It is now widely accepted that the current global rate of change in climate 
is as a result of human activity. As global air or sea temperature changes, even by just 1 or 2 
degrees, the habitats in which species live will also change and may even become uninhabitable 
to some species.  
 45 
  
2.2.6 ENDANGERED AND ENDEMIC SPECIES  
 
Endangered species A species whose numbers are reduced to the point. That means endangered 
species are in immediate danger of extinction.  
The International Union Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) classified the species of plants and 
animals as:  
(a) Endangered species  
 (b) Thr eatened species: Species ( including animals, plants, fungi, etc.) which are vulnerable to 
endangerment in the near future)  
(c) Rare species : Among the important endangered animal species, Indian wild ass; the Kashmir 
stag, the Golden Langur etc .. are co nsidered highly endangered. There are also  
endangered bird species like Siberian crane; the great Indian Bustard; the florican etc..  
The IUCN published the data on endangered species of both plants and animals of India. The 
data symbolizes the working sign al for those species which are endangered and if not protected 
are likely to become extinct in near future  
A species is said to be extinct when it is not seen in the wild for 50 years at a stretch e.g. Dodo, 
Passenger Pigeon.  
A species is said to be endang ered when its number has been reduced to a critical level or whose 
habitat, have been drastically reduced and if such species is not protected and conserved, it is in 
immediate danger of extinction.  
 
Endangered species of India  
 
The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources(IUCN) publishes the 
Red Data Book which include the list of endangered species of plants and animals. The red data 
symbolizes the warning signal for those species which are endangered  and if not protected are 
likely to  become extinct in near future  
 
The animals that are listed under the critically endangered category are as under:   
 
1)MalabarLargeSpottedCivet  
2)NamdaphaFlyingSquirrel  
3)SalimAli'sFruitBat

 46 
 Endemic species of India  
 
 India has two biodiversity hot -spots and thus possesses  a large number of endemic species.  
 
 The endemic species are those taxa whose distribution is confined to a restricted area due to 
their specific ecological niches and edaphic gradients. Therefore, t he habitats of endemic species 
are far more vulnerable than other species. Endemic species once lost, it is a loss of biodiversity 
of these species forever . 
 
 In India there are about 5725 endemic taxa of angiosperms (33.5% of Indian flora) which are 
locat ed in 25 hot spots. The major hotspots in India which contain largest number of endemic 
plant species are the Southern Western Ghats and Eastern Himalayas with 1286 and 1808 
endemic species respectively. There are about 1272 species of endemic angiosperms out of 3800 
species occurring in Kerala (33.5% of Kerala flora) which represent 22.6% of Indian endemics. 
Seventy percent of the 1272 species of endemics have the major areas of distribution in Kerala 
with spill over in adjacent regions. On the basis of th e study of the distributional range, about 
102 endemic species occur exclusively in Kerala.  
 
A large number out of a total of 81,000 of animals in our country is endemic. The Western  Ghats  
are particularly rich in amphibians (frogs, toads etc) and reptiles  (lizards, crocodiles etc) about  
62% amphibians and 50% lizards are endemic to Western Ghats   
 
 
.2.2.7 CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY  
 
In order to maintain and conserve biodiversity, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, 
government of India has already taken several steps to manage wildlife, the objectives of which 
are: 
1. Maintenance of a number of species in protected areas such as National Parks, Sanctuaries..  
2. To improve the biosphere reserves  
3. Implement strict restrictions of export of r are plants and animals  
4. Educate the public on these through the government agencies and NGO’s.  
 
 
47 
  
A) In -situ conservation : The preservation of species in its natural ecosystem  is called in -situ 
conservation. As a consequence, protected areas are being identified and maintained for natural 
conservation of species by individual countries. For the conservation and management of 
endangered species several projects have been establi shed.  
These are:  
 
Tiger Projects : Corbett National Park which is 300 km from New Delhi is the oldest National 
Park of India having 1318.54 sq km. It was one of the nine Tiger Reserves created at the launch 
of the Project Tiger in 1973.  
 
Gir Lion Projects : The Gir Forest of Gujarat where lions are found. This has an area of 1412 sq 
kms and declared as a National Park.  
 
Elephant Projects:  The objective was to ensure long -term survival of population of elephants  
( not come into operations). Project Elephant  (PE), a centrally sponsored scheme, was launched 
in February 1992 to provide financial and technical support to major elephant bearing States in  
the country for protection of elephants and their habitats. The Project is being implemented in 13 
States/UTs,  viz..Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, 
Meghalaya, Nagaland, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  
There are about 7000 protected areas in the world which include a variety of National parks, 
Sanctuaries etc which vary in size (between 100 to 500 sq km), purpose (protection of one or 
more species and their habitats).. In India, there are 39 National Parks and 492 wildlife 
sanctuaries.  
 
National Parks:  These are protected areas exclusively for wild life. Human activities like 
hunting,  Firewood collection, timber harvesting etc… are restricted in these areas to that wild 
plants and animals could grow in a protected environment  
 
The following measures sho uld be adopted for the conservation of biodiversity:  
1. Over grazing in the forest and areas of vegetation should be controlled because it may  
     Destroy the useful rare plants.  
2. The habitat of plants and animals should be conserved.  
3. The natural condition of ecosystem should be studied and researched in time and again, then  
     Specific programs for conservation should be conducted.  
4. Human activities should be done without destroying natural environment.  
5. Illegal hunting and s muggling of animals and plants should be strictly avoided.  
6. Effective laws and rules should be adopted for the conservation of rare animals and plants.  
7. Industries are established from the raw materials. During the process of collecting raw  
    materi als, care should be taken not to destroy useful plants and habitats of animals.  
8. Public awareness should be created about the importance of rare animals and plants, causes  
    of rareness and measures for their preservation.  
 
B) Ex -situ conservation: The conservation of elements of biodiversity out of the context of their 
natural habitats is referred to as ex -situ conservation. Zoos, botanical gardens and seed banks are 
all example of ex -situ conservation. In India we have the following important gene an d seed 
bank facilities.  
 48 
 i) National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) is located in New Delhi. Here

ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, GLOBAL  
ENVIRONMENTAL ISUES AND CONTROL MEASURES  
 
3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION  
 
INTRODUCTION : 
  
According to ODUM (1971) , Pollution is “an undesirable change  in the characteristics of air, 
water and land that harmfully affect the life and also creat e health hazards for all living 
organisms on the  globe” . 
According to SOUTHWICK (1976 ), Pollution can be defined as “the unfavorable (or) 
alteration of environment caused by human activities and causing harm to human beings” . 
 
TYPES OF POLLUTION:  
 
Basically the Pollution is of two types viz.,  
 
(1) Natural Pollution : This type of pollution is limited in its occurrence generally from natural 
hazards like volcanic eruptions, emissions of natural gas, soil erosion, ultraviolet rays, cosmic 
rays etc and  
(2) Manmade  Pollution : Most of the pollution is man made only. However, Pollution is usually 
categorized as Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Thermal Pollution; Noise Pollution; Land & soil 
Pollution; Radio Active Pollution and Marine Pollution  
 
3.1.1 AIR POLLUTION  
Air pollution may be described as “ the imbalance in quality of air so as to cause adverse 
effects on the living organisms existing on earth ”. Pollution is due  to the presence of 
undesirable substance of sufficient quantity which exists in environment .  
The substance or energy which causes pollution is called pollutant .  
 
Types of air pollutants:  
Pollutants may be classified according to origin and state of matt er. 
 
a) According to Origin: Air pollutants are divided into two categories as primary & secondary.  
1) Primary air pollutants are those which are emitted directly into the atmosphere.  
Eg: C; CO; CO 2; SOx ; N; S; H; NOx; CFC’s etc .  
2) Secondary air pollu tants are those which are produced in the air by the interaction  
    Among  the primary air pollutants or by reaction with atmospheric constituents.  
Eg: Ozone (O 3); Smog; Para Acetyl Nitrate (PAN) ; Acid Rain ; Aerosols.  
b) According to State of Matter: Air pollutants include fine solids; liquids and gases. Dust, 
Smoke, Fumes etc are examples for solid particles whereas fog is an example for liquid particles.  
 50 
 PRIMARY POLLUTANTS  
1. Carbon Monoxide: It is a colorless, odor less, poisonous gas that is produced by the 
incomplete burning of carbon based fuels (coal, petrol, diesel and wood) which comes from the 
automobile industries, exhaust devices, About 70% of CO emissions are from the transport 
sector.  
When the air is pollu ted with CO, human blood is likely to be deprived of oxygen and leads to 
coma and death. In mild dosages, it leads to headache.  
 
2. Oxides of Sulphur: SO 2 is a gas produced from burning of coal, mainly in thermal power 
plants. Some industries such as paper  mills produce SO 2. It is injurious not only to men and 
plants, but it also attacks rapidly a few rocks such as limestone, marbles, electric contacts etc. It 
can even dissolve nylon.  
Paper absorbs SO 2 causing the paper to become brittle and fragile. SO 2 polluted air leads to 
corrosion of metals such as Fe, Zn, Cu, steel etc… SO 2 is a major contributor to Smog and acid 
rain. 
Sulphur trioxide is more irritant than SO 2 because it combines immediately with water to form 
sulphuric acid.  
 
3. Oxides of Nitrogen : Combustion of coal, oil, natural gas and gasoline which produces upto 50 
ppm of Nitrogen. NOx are also produced when fossil fuels are burned especially in power plants 
and motor vehicles. NO 2poisoning results SILOFILTER disease. High levels of NO 2 exposure 
causes cough and make the human beings feel short of breath. People who are exposed to NO 2 
for a long time have a higher chance of getting respiratory infections.  
NOx compounds contribute for the formation of Ozone. Similarly, when nitrogen oxide 
when combi ne with SOx to form acid rain.  
 
4. Chloro Fluoro Carbons: CFC’s (also known as Freon) are non - toxic. They contain Carbon, 
Fluorine and Chlorine atoms.The five main CFCs are the following:  
 CFC – 11 ( Trichloro Fluoro Methane CFCl 3 ) 
 CFC – 12 ( Dichloro  Fluoro Methane CF 2Cl2 ) 
The major uses of CFCs are as coolants in refrigerators and in air conditioners; as solvents in 
cleaners particularly for electronic circuit boards etc.. CFCs are the main cause of ozone 
depletion. CFCs have a lifetime in the atmos phere of about 20 to 100 years, and as a result one 
free chlorine atom from a CFC molecule can do a lot of damage.  
 
SECONDARY POLLUTANTS:  
1) Ozone (O 3) / Ozone layer Depletion : Ozone consists of oxygen molecules which contain 
three oxygen atoms. It is not emitted directly into the air but produced in the atmosphere when 
oxygen combines with oxygen radical ( O.) in the presence of sunlight. Ozone protects us from 
ultra violet radiation and other harmful rays.  
It is observed that over the last few years, m any manmade  processes release gases into 
atmosphere causing drastic depletion of ozone layer. The chlorine atoms cause depletion of 
ozone slowly and holes are formed in the ozone layer.  
Ozone reacts with tissues and cause for breathing and decrease the wor king ability of the lungs, 
chest pains and coughing. It lowers the human body resistance power and leads to cold; 
pneumonia also.  51 
 Antarctic Ozone depletion: According to NIMBUS -7 satellite picture which was taken on 5th 
October, 1987 the protective ozone l ayer showed a hole over 50% of the area of the Antarctica 
continent covering 7 million sq km.  
On Jan 1st 1989, the country Montreal (Canada) proposed redesigning refrigeration, air 
conditioning technology replacing the use of CFCs by ozone friendly substit utes. 
 
2) Smog: Smog is a combination of smoke and fog or various gases when react in the presence of 
sunlight. The effects of smog on human health cause for respiratory, irritation to the eyes, 
diseases related to nose, throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, heada che, nerves, liver, and kidneys . 
The first smog related deaths were recorded in London in 1873, when it killed 500 people. In 
1892, December, London had worst experiences causing 1000 deaths. In 1940’s severe smog 
began covering the cities of Los Angeles i n USA.  
 
3) Acid rain: Acid rain has become one of the most important global environmental problems 
and poses significant adverse impact on soils, rivers, lakes, forests and monuments. The 
phenomenon occurs when SOx and NOx from the burning of fossil fuels s uch as Petrol, Diesel, 
Coat etc combine with water vapour in atmosphere and fall as rain or snow or fog.  
Natural sources like volcanoes, forest fires, etc also contribute SOx and NOx . Increased 
urban and industrial activities cause air pollution resulting in the rise of concentration of SO 2 and 
NOx. Sulphur dioxide and NO 2 combines with water vapour in the atmosphere produce sulphuric 
acid and Nitric acid respectively and results acid rain. Some of the examples are:  
Europe and parts of W Asia have experienced rain with water pH range of 4.5 to 5.0 (acidic) in 
1958.  
 
AIR POLLUTION EFFECTS, PREVENTION AND CONTROL MEASURES:  
Human beings breathe 22000 times a day on the average, inhaling 16 kg of air. Atmosphere 
constitutes a protective cover of gases s urrounding the earth which  
sustains life and saves it from unfriendly environment.  
The atmosphere consists of several layers viz. Troposphere, Stratosphere; Mesosphere; 
Thermosphere & Exosphere.  
The lower atmosphere i.e., the troposphere contains 70% of gaseous components of major, minor 
and traces. Ultra violet radiation from the sun is absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere which is 
so called ozone layer located between 17 - 26 kms above sea level.  
 
Effects of Air pollution: The effects of pollution may be direct and affect certain organisms. 
The effects of pollution may possess  a hazard or nuisance. Long continued pollution even affects 
the evolution of a species and eliminates organisms that cannot tolerate certain pollutants and 
favor others who can ea t. 
Air pollution causes deaths, Impair health, reduce visibility and brings vast economic losses. It 
can also cause intangible losses to historic monuments such as Taj Mahal.  
Finally, Air pollution can affect the environment on a global scale.  
 
Prevention and control of Air Pollution:  
• Inputs that do not contain the pollutants.  
• Operating process to minimize generation of the pollutants.  
• Replacing the process with one does not generate the pollutant.  
• Removing the pollutants from the process.  
• Substitution of raw materials.  52 
 Eg: The substitution of high sulphur coal with low sulphur coal in power plants.  
Eg: Changing a fossil fuel with nuclear energy can eliminate sulphur emission.  
• By involving the Process Modification:  
Eg: Chemical and petroleum  industries have changed by implementing  
                               Automated  operations, computerized process control by reducing the   
                               Oxidation  ofSO 2 to SO 3 by reducing excess air.  
• By involving the control technologies : Control equipment viz., Wet Collector 
(scrubber), Gravity Settling chamber; Cyclone Collectors, Dry Scrubbers, filters, 
electrostatic precipitators etc. are to be used to minimize the air pollution.  
 
3.1.2 WATER POLLUTION  
 
Hydrosphere in the universe contains water in the form of oceans, rivers, lakes, tanks and many 
other water sources.  
Water sources in the world are of two types.  
They are (1) Marine water bodies and (2) Fresh Water bodies.  
Water is a good solvent for man y substances. Because of this property water cannot exist in its  
pure form at many parts of the world. Water pollution is mainly because of sewage, industrial 
disposals i.e., effluents.  
 
PARAMETERS OF WATER POLLUTION:  
Chemical examination of water (tests):  pH; Biological Oxygen Demand ( BOD ), Dissolved  
Oxygen ( DO), etc are some of the chemical tests to find the stage of pollution of water.  
 
1. pH : The value of pH gives the degree of acidity or alkalinity of polluted water. Determination 
of pH is important in  calculating the coagulant (thick or thin) dose.  
 
 
2. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) : It is defined as the quantity of oxygen utilized by micro 
organisms at a temperature of 20oC, generally measured for 5 days. When water is polluted by 
unwanted materials, naturally the O 2 content gets reduced and that water become not fit for 
consumption either by human beings or animals or plants.  
Living organisms require water with some quantity of sustainable oxygen in it. That oxygen is 
necessary for living o rganisms is generally called BOD . If there is reduction in oxygen content of 
water, it becomes unfit for biological consumption because there is change in BOD.  
 
 
COMMON TYPES OF WATER POLLUTANTS:  
A) Based on sources                                                         B) Based on natures  
 
A) Based on sources:  
a) Disease causing agents: Bacteria, viruses, protozoan that enter water from domestic sewage 
and animal wastes.  
b) Water soluble inorganic chemicals : Acids, salts and compounds of toxic metals such  as 
Lead, Mercury can make water unfit to drink, harm fishes and other aquatic life. Also Nitrate, 
Phosphate compounds dissolve in water that can cause excessive growth of algae, which then die 
and decay, depleting dissolved O 2 in water and killing fish.  53 
 c) Water Soluble Organic chemicals: Oil, gasoline (a type of oil is obtained from petroleum), 
pesticides, detergents and many other water soluble chemicals that threaten human health and 
harm fish.  
d) Heat: Large quantity of water is heated when it is used in the cooling towers of thermal power 
plants. When this hot water is discharged into the nearby water bodies, it causes an increase in its 
temperature.  
e) Sewage: sewage is waste water from municipal area where there is human habitation. Sewage 
which come s from homes is called domestic sewage  
 
B) Based on natures:  
In nature water pollution is classified into three types by Kimball  (1975). They are:  
1. Domestic water pollution: Sewage is a part of domestic water pollution. Domestic sewage 
not only contains unwanted waste materials, but it is also infested with harmful bacteria, virus 
etc. These are responsible for causing diseases in animals and human beings, if they drink this 
polluted water and even plants may die if polluted water is provided. Do mestic water pollution 
leads to Diarrhea, Cholera and Typhoid in human beings.  
 
2. Agricultural Water Pollution: Water require for plants for its growth. Major irrigation, 
minor irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, lift irrigation carry waste  substances and 
causing water pollution in addition to the utilization of fertilizer and pesticides. Agricultural 
water pollution leads to Eutrophication & Water Bloom.  
 
Ecological effects: The important troubling ecological impacts are:  
1. Excessive nutrient s in water bodies promote plant growth which leads to a drop in 
water quality;  
2. Disruption of the natural ecosystem E.g. lack of oxygen for shelf marine life (causing  
a drop in their population).  
3. Decrease in the recreational and aesthetic value of water  bodies  
4. Health problems when it occurs in drinking water reserves  
5. Coral reef decline  
6. Decreased biodiversity,  
7. Changes in species composition and dominance, and  
8. Toxicity effects.  
9. Toxic phytoplankton species  
10. Decreases in water transparen cy (increased turbidity)  
11. Color, smell, and water treatment problems  
12. Dissolved oxygen depletion  
13. Increased incidences of fish kills  
14. Loss of desirable fish species  
 
3. Industrial water pollution: Many industries discharge waste materials containing harmful 
chemicals. Such Industrial wastes are called effluents . The river Godavari is polluted because of 
effluents released by the paper industry. It affects the entire water ecosystem causing enormous 
damage to fishes, prawns and fresh water animals.  
 Eg: Minamata disease & Fluorosis.  
Minamata disease is a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. Symptoms 
include ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, narrowing  of the field 54 
 of vision and damage to hearing and speech. In extreme cases, insanity, paralysis, coma, and 
death follow within weeks of the onset of symptoms.  
Minamata disease was first discovered in Minamata city in Japan in 1956. It was caused by the 
release of methyl mercury from, the Chisso Corporation's chemical factory, which continued 
from 1932 to 1968. This highly toxic chemical bio - accumulated in shellfish and fish in 
Minamata  
Bay which when eaten by the local people resulted in mercury poisoning.  While cat, dog, pig, 
and human deaths continued over more than 30 years, the government and company did little to 
prevent the pollution.  
Fluorosis: People suffer from a disease called fluorosis after consuming water containing 
fluorine for sufficiently a long time. Quantity of fluoride in water is only 1 ppm. Diseases caused 
by fluorosis are:  
 Back pain and cannot easily bend.  
 Joints get stiffened as so movement of joints is impaired.  
 Teeth are the worst effected and a brown coating appears on the ena mel 
    of teeth giving bad appearance.  
 Persons with fluorosis cannot erect freely.  
 
CONTROL MEASURES OF WATER POLLUTION:  
1. Drinking water should be boiled, cooled and then used.  
2. Disinfection of drinking water should be done by using chemicals like bleaching powder.  
3. Pesticides and insecticides should be prevented from nearby use of water lakes,ponds and  
pools.  
4. Drainage water should not be allowed to mix with drinking water.  
5. Drainage system should be maintained properly.  
6. Ch lorination process is to be adopted for drinking water. For 1 litre of water 30 - 40 mg of  
     chlorine is to be added to get perfect disinfection. It kills bacteria, fungi, fungal spores  
    and other microbes also.  
 
 
3.1.3 SOIL POLLUTION  
 
Definition:  
Soil pollution is defined as the build -up in soils of persistent toxic compounds, chemicals, salts,  
Radioactive  materials, or disease causing agents, which have adverse effects on plant growth and 
animal health.  Soil is the thin layer of organic and inorga nic materials that covers the Earth's 
rocky surface.  The organic portion, which is derived from the decayed remains of plants and 
animals, is concentrated in the dark uppermost topsoil. The inorganic portion made up of rock 
fragments, was formed over thous ands of years by physical and chemical weathering of bedrock. 
Productive soils are necessary for agriculture to supply the world with sufficient food.  
 
There are many different ways that soil can become polluted, such as:  
• Seepage from a landfill  
• Discha rge of industrial waste into the soil  
• Percolation of contaminated water into the soil  
• Rupture of underground storage tanks  
• Excess application of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizer  
• Solid waste seepage  55 
 The most common chemicals involved in causing soil pollution are:  
• Petroleum hydrocarbons  
• Heavy metals  
• Pesticides  
• Solvents  
 
Types of Soil Pollution  
• Agricultural Soil Pollution and pollution due to urban activities  
i) Pollution of surface soil  
ii) Pollution of underground soil  
• Soil p ollution by industrial effluents and solid wastes  
i) Pollution of surface soil  
ii) Disturbances in soil profile  
 
CAUSES OF SOIL POLLUTION:  
Soil pollution is caused by the presence of man -made chemicals or other alteration in the natural 
soil environment. T his type of contamination typically arises from the rupture of underground 
storage links, application of pesticides, and percolation  of contaminated surface water to 
subsurface strata, oil and fuel dumping, leaching of wastes from landfills or direct disch arge of 
industrial wastes to the soil. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, 
solvents, pesticides, lead and other heavy metals. This occurrence of this phenomenon is 
correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensities o f chemical usage.  
A soil pollutant is any factor which deteriorates the quality, texture and mineral content of the  
Soil or which disturbs the biological balance of the organisms in the soil. Pollution in soil has 
adverse effect on plant growth.  
 
Pollution  in soil is associated with  
• Indiscriminate use of fertilizers  
• Indiscriminate use of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides  
• Dumping of large quantities of solid waste  
• Deforestation and soil erosion  
 
1. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers:  
Soil nutrients are important for plant growth and development. Plants obtain carbon, hydrogen  
and oxygen from air and water. But other necessary nutri ents like nitrogen, phosphorus, 
potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur and more must be obtained from the soil. Farmers 
generally use fertilizers  to correct soil deficiencies.  Fertilizers contaminate the soil with 
impurities, which come from the raw materials used for their manufacture. Mixed fertilizers 
often contain ammonium nitrate (NH 4NO 3), phosphorus as P 2O5, and potassium as K 2O. For 
instance, arsenic, lead and cadmium present in traces in rock  phosphate mineral get transferred to 
super phosphate fertilizer. Since the metals are not degradable, their accumulation in the soil 
above their toxic levels due to exc essive use of phosphate fertilizers becomes an indestructible 
poison for crops.  
The over use of NPK fertilizers reduce quantity of vegetables and crops grown on soil over the  
years. It also reduces the protein content of wheat, maize, grams, etc., grown on  that soil. The  
carbohydrate quality of such crops also gets degraded. Excess potassium content in soil 
decreases Vitamin C and carotene content in vegetables and fr uits. The vegetables and fruits 
grown on over fertilized soil are more prone to attacks by insects and disease.  56 
  
2. Indiscriminate use of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides:  
The first widespread insecticide use began at the end of World War II and included DDT 
(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and gammaxene . Insects soon became resistant to  DDT 
and as the chemical did not decompose readily, it persisted in the environment. Since it was 
soluble in fat rather than water, it biomagnified up the food chain and disrupted calcium 
metabolism in birds, causing egg shells to be thin and fragile. As a  result, large birds of prey 
such as the brown pelican, ospreys, falcons and eagles became endangered. DDT has been now 
been banned in most western countries. Ironically many of them including USA still produce 
DDT for export to other developing nations wh ose needs outweigh the problems caused by it.  
The most important pesticides are DDT, BHC, chlorinated hydrocarbons, 
organophosphates,  
aldrin, malathion, dieldrin, furodan, etc.  The remnants of such pesticides used on pests may 
get adsorbed by the soil part icles, which then contaminate root crops grown in that soil. The 
consumption of such crops causes the pesticides remnants to enter human biological systems, 
affecting them adversely.  
An infamous herbicide used as a defoliant in the Vietnam War called Agent  Orange 
(dioxin), exposure to Agent Orange.  
Pesticides not only bring toxic effect on human and animals but also decrease the fertility of the  
soil. Some of the pesticides are quite stable and their bio - degradation may take weeks and even 
months.  
Pesticide problems such as resistance, resurgence, and health  effects have caused scientists to  
seek alternatives. Pheromones and hormones to attract or repel insects and using natural enemies 
or sterilization by radiation have been suggested  
 
3. Dumping o f large quantities of solid waste:  
In general, solid waste includes garbage, domestic refuse and discarded solid materials such as  
Those  from commercial, industrial and agricultural operations. They contain increasing amounts 
of paper, cardboards, plastics , glass, old construction material, packaging material and toxic or 
otherwise hazardous substances. Since a significant amount of urban solid waste tends to be 
paper and food waste, the majority is recyclable or biodegradable in landfills. Similarly, most 
agricultural waste is recycled and mining waste is left on site.  
The portion of solid waste that is hazardous such as oils, battery metals, heavy metals from  
smelting industries and organic solvents are the ones we have to pay particular attention to. 
Thes e can in the long run, get deposited to the soils of the surrounding area and pollute them by 
altering their chemical and biological properties. They also contaminate drinking water aquifer 
sources. More than 90% of hazardous waste is produced by chemical,  petroleum and metal -
related industries and small businesses such as dry cleaners and gas stations contribute as well.  
 
4. Deforestation and soil erosion:  
Soil Erosion occurs when the weathered soil particles are dislodged and carried away by wind  
or water. Deforestation, agricultural development, temperature extremes, precipitation including 
acid rain, and human activities contribute to this erosion. Humans speed up this process by 
construction, mining, cutting of timber, over cropping and overgrazing . It results in floods and 
cause soil erosion.  
 
 
 57 
 EFFECTS OF SOIL POLLUTION  
1. Agricultural  
• Reduced soil fertility  
• Reduced nitrogen fixation  
• Increased erosion  
• Larger loss of soil and nutrients  
• Deposition of silt in tanks and reservoirs  
• Reduced cro p yield  
• Imbalance in soil fauna and flora  
2. Industrial  
• Dangerous chemicals entering underground water  
• Ecological imbalance  
• Release of pollutant gases  
• Release of radioactive rays causing health problems  
• Increased salinity  
• Reduced vegetation  
3. Urban  
Clogging of drains  
• Inundation of areas  
• Public health problems  
• Pollution of drinking water sources  
• Foul smell and release of gases  
• Waste management problems  
 
CONTROL MEASURES OF SOIL POLLUTION  
The following steps have been suggested to control soil pollution. To help prevent soil erosion,  
we can limit construction in sensitive area. In general we would need less fertilizer and fewer 
pesticides if we could all adopt the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. This would give u s 
less solid waste.  
1. Reducing chemical fertilizer and pesticide use  Applying bio -fertilizers and manures can 
reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use. Biological methods of pest control can also reduce 
the use of pesticides and thereby minimize soil pollution.  
2. Reusing of materials  
Materials such as glass containers, plastic bags, paper, cloth etc. can be reused at domestic  levels 
rather than being disposed, reducing solid waste pollution.  
3. Recycling and recovery of materials  
This is a reasonable solution for reducing soil pollution. Materials such as paper, some kinds of  
plastics and glass can and are being recycled. This decreases the volume of refuse and helps in 
the conservation of natural resources. For example, recovery of one tonn e of paper can save 17 
trees.  
4. Reforesting  
Control of land loss and soil erosion can be attempted through restoring forest and grass cover  
to check wastelands, soil erosion and floods. Crop rotation or mixed cropping can improve the 
fertility of the land . 
5. Solid waste treatment  
Proper methods should be adopted for management of solid waste disposal. Industrial wastes  58 
 can be treated physically, chemically and biologically until they are less hazardous. Acidic and 
alkaline wastes should be first neutraliz ed; the insoluble material if biodegradable should be 
allowed to degrade under controlled conditions before being disposed.  
 
 
3.1.4 MARINE POLLUTION  
 
Pollution of oceans is damaging the marine environment and is becoming a major problem. 
Marine environment  is interesting for various reasons such as Sea food; Navigation; Adventure; 
Tourism etc,, Marine Pollution is harmful and its danger can be identified in a variety of ways.  
 
Sources & causes of marine pollution : 
Marine pollution originates from one of two sources --- the land or the sea which are explained 
below:  
Marine Oil Pollution : Oil is basically an important pollutant which destroys marine 
environment. The various sources of oil pollution are:  
Run-off oil from streets; disposal of lubricants from machines; Off shore oil and gas exploitation 
from off -shore drilling; blowouts at off -shore drilling rigs; oil escaping under high pressure from 
a bore hole in the ocean floor. Waste chemicals, mud and accumulation of toxic substances in 
the ocean in thefo rm of mercury, dioxin, PCBs, PAHs (Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons) 
Radioactivity. benzene; xylene ( colorless, flammable liquids ) and heavy metals such as 
lead; copper; nickel, mercury also cause for marine pollution during the off shore drilling 
activities. Both dumping and exploitation of ocean resources cause  ocean pollution also.  
PAHs: It is a chemical compound and organic pollutant. These occur in oil, coal and tar deposits 
and are produced as byproducts  of fuel burning.  
PAHs are lipophilic meaning they mix more easily in oil than water.  
Eg for PAHs are:  Acenaphthene; Anthracene; Benzopyrene; Chrysene; Coronene; Fluorene;  
Pyrene.  
 
Other sources from land: The major sources of marine pollution originating from the land vary 
from country to country. Effluents are discharged either directly into the sea or enters the coastal 
waters through rivers. Thousands of barrels of oil burn when oil wells were set on fir e. Tanker 
accidents on land carry  oil to the nearby streams / canals and cause for marine  Pollution . Due to 
burning of oil, smoke, SO2, NO2, CO is  added towards atmospheric contamination.  
 
The effects of oil pollution depend mainly on the following factors : 
Type of oil and its viscosity, amount / quantity released, distance covered, time, average water 
temp etc..  
Effects of Marine Pollution:  
S No      Source                   Effect  
1  Sewage & run - off from forestry;        Depletes oxygen in water causes killing of fishes.  
2  Sediments from mining   Sediments clog in the gills of fishes  
3           Sewage from municipalities,               Contaminate sea food  
             towns; cities etc…  
4           Industrial discharge; pesticides           Cau se disease in coastal marine life  
             from farms  
5          Oil from off shore drilling;   Low level contamination kill larvae whereas high  
             industries/ automobiles                        level contamination causes death for sea fishes  59 
 6         Litter (rubbish), waste, plastics  Marine life disturbs  
7         Hot water from power plants               Kills corals.  
 
 
Marine Pollut ion Abatement / Prevention & control measures of Marine pollution : 
 
The following are the some of the control measures for marine pollution:  
1. Improving existing sewage disposal facilities  
2. Ensuring individual houses have sewage disposal systems (such as sept ic tanks) . 
3. Large resorts should use and manage their own packaged treatment plants.  
4. Marine planning and management should be considered as processes such as land – sea 
interaction; inter disciplinary co -operation; participation of public & private sector 
organizations; balance between protection and development public participation  
5. Oil tankers are double hulled ( two layered bottom ) to reduce the chance of oil leakage  
6. Recycling facilities for used oil.  
 
 
3.1.5 NOISE POLLUTION  
 
INTRODUCTION:  
Everyone knows that sound is a form of energy that is capable of causing disturbances in human 
beings. Ears are the hearing organs in human beings.  
A thin membrane is called Tympanum (or) ear drum receives the vibrations produced  
by sound to a limited ext ent. Human ear is capable of perceiving about 85 decibels of sound. 
Beyond the limit, the ear drum cannot bear sound.  
In nature, we hear different types of sounds. Sound is a kind of vibration which travel through 
air, water, and are sensed by the ear. Thi s is from music, speech, etc from radio / television / 
computers etc., one thing in this matter is that we can increase the volume of sound or decrease 
as per our taste whereas, a noise is a sound which cannot be heard clearly and only mixed sounds 
will be  heard.  
For eg: in an office one is talking on mobile, phone ringing another side, ring tones in some 
person's hands, loud conversations with one and another etc., this is called noise. One cannot 
increase or decrease the volume of noise. In general, a so und is a vibration from a particular 
machine, place or material which can be heard clearly whereas a noise a mixed vibrations that 
will come to us from all directions. A sound can be clear and can be able to hear, whereas a noise 
will not be clear and cann ot be heard.  
 
SOURCES OF NOISE:  
Noise is an unwanted sound and noise pollution occurs through different sources:  
1. Vehicles produce noise that leads to noise pollution.  
2. Automobile industry is another source of noise pollution.  
3. Noise pollution is ver y common in industrial areas where machines are working for factories  
    making more noise.  
The sources of noise are more in urban and industrial areas, than in rural areas. The sources of 
noise may be stationary or mobile. The stationary sources include  industries, loud speakers, 
mining operations, use of machineries, TV, Radio and Grinders etc. The mobile sources include 
Road Traffic, Highway Noise, Railway Traffic and Air Traffic.  
 60 
 (1) Stationary sources:  
a) Industrial noise: The main categories of industrial activity that are particularly  
relevant to the study of noise are the following:  
Product fabrication, Product assembly, Power generation by means of  generators , Combusting  
process in furnaces (burning of gases)  
b) Noise from construction works: Construction noise, a major source of noise 
pollution is emitted by construction equipment. The sources of noise are dozers excavators, front 
end loaders, soil compactors, cranes, air compressors, concrete vibrators, riveting steel structure 
during the casting, dismantling of construction materials etc...  
c) Noise from other sources: These include sources such as sirens, barking dogs,  
ambulances, Police vehicles, Fire engines etc.  
 
(2) Mobile sources:  
Road traffic : Of all s ources of noise pollution, road traffic is the most prevalent  and 
perhaps the most source of noise pollution. More people are exposed to noise  from motor 
vehicles and the noise depends on various factors such as Road  location, Road design, Vehicle 
standard s, Driver behaviors, Horns, Traffic density. ,  
 
Noise of common road vehicles  
 
Vehicle type      Noise (db)  
 
Medium road traffic (Main roads)   70- 80 
Heavy road traffic (High ways)   80- 90 
Buses &  Trucks upto 3.5 tons   85- 95 
Trucks upto 3.5 -12 tons    90-100 
Motor cycles      90-105 
 
It can be observed that motor cycles with their exposed engines and inadequate silencing 
arrangements are notorious noise producers, which produce more than 30 times sound than a 
small passenger c ar. 
 
a) Railway traffic: Noise from railway traffic is not serious nuisance as compared to the road 
traffic noise. The level of noise associated with rail traffic is related to the type of engine, the 
speed of the train, track type and condition. The major ity of noise emitted by trains is produced 
by the engine (or) by the interaction of wheels with the tracks, horns, warning signals at 
crossings etc..,  
 
b) Air traffic: The noise of air craft is different from that of road traffic in the sense it is 
intermittent. Noise is maximum during takeoff  and landing. Noise made by jet planes is more 
disturbance than that of propeller driven air craft. Supersonic air craft produce n oise at high 
levels due to its intensity.  
 
EFFECTS OF NOISE:  
At 120 decibels the ear registers pain but hearing damage begins about 85 decibels. Apart from 
hearing loss, noise can cause lack of sleep, irritation, indigestion, ulcers, High B.P., Heart 
diseases , Stress etc.,.  
1. Annoyance  (Feeling slightly angry): One of the most important effects of noise on human is     61 
                                                                       annoyance. Due to this breathing rate affects.  
2.Noise - induced hea ring loss: Exposure to noise for a long enough duration results in damage  
                                                     to the inner ear and thus decreases one’s ability to hear. The  
                                                    louder the no ise the less time it takes to cause hearing loss.  
 
3.Effects on sleep: Noise disturbs sleep. It has been found that the cases related to various  
                                    levels of noise are associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbance 
by noise  depends on the characteristics of the noise such as frequency,   
                                   loudness and whether the noise is continuous or intermittent.  
Other effects: There are many other effects of noises such involve aggression (ready to attack). 
People may turn mad and nerves may not function normally, People may be deformed in many 
ways including increased stress and strain, nonfunctioning of hands, legs etc due to noise 
pollution if exposed continuously.  
 
CONTROL MEASURES:  
 
Noise po llution could be controlled by either reducing the noise at the source or by preventing its 
transmission.  
The first step in the prevention of noise pollution is to control the noise at source itself .  
For eg: Lubrication of machines reduces the noise produ ced, Tightening the loose  nuts, Reducing 
the vibrations produced by machines etc…  
Failing to control the noise at its source, the second step is to prevent its transmission for eg: 
keeping the noise machine covered in an enclosure so that the sound  does no t escape and reach 
the receivers, construction of noise barriers on road  sides, sound proof the buildings by using 
heavy curtains on the windows, acoustical  tiles on the ceiling and walls, by sealing the cracks in 
the walls to reduce the  noise coming from outside.  
If the noise levels are not able to bring down to the desired levels in some cases, the only 
alternative is to follow:  
• Avoiding horns except in emergency situations.  
• Sound proof or eco -generators and Turning down the volume of stereos.  
• Conducting the awareness programs  
 
3.1.6 THERMAL POLLUTION  
 
Thermal pollution is also known as heat pollution and occurs when heat is released into water or 
air that produces undesirable effects. Sudden heat release usually due to forest fire or volcanoes 
or human induced activities. Thermal pollution is also the addition of excess undesirable heat to 
water that makes it harmful to human, animal or aquatic life.  
 
Sources of Thermal Pollution : 
Various sources of thermal pollution include  
Thermal Po wer Plants ; Nuclear Power Plants ; Petroleum Refineries; Steel Plants; Metallurgical 
industries; Paper Mills; Chemical Plants. Coal fired power plants constitute major sources of 
thermal pollution. Nuclear plants discharge much heat and also traces of tox ic radioactive  
substances. Many industries use water for cooling purpose and thus the heat effluents are  finally 
discharged into water.  
 62 
 Temperature and its effects:  Temperature  plays an important role in determining the conditions 
in which living things c an survive.  
Birds and mammals require a narrow range of body temp for survival whereas aquatic species 
can exist at a certain range of temperatures.  
Thermal pollution increases water temperature causing a change (lowering) of dissolved oxygen 
levels. Thi s disrupts and causes decay of plant and animal species.  
For eg: The warmer water increases the metabolic rate of fish and other animals in the sea; this 
decreases the life expectancy of aquatic animals.  
 
Management of Thermal Pollution:  
Thermal Pollution is controlled by the following methods:  
1. Cooling Towers are designed to control the temperature of water which transfers  some of the    
heat from the water to the surrounding atmosphere by evaporation. There are two types of    
cooling towers n amely wet cooling towers and dry cooling towers.  
2. Cooling ponds are employed for thermal discharges. Heated effluents on the surface of water      
      in cooling ponds maximize dissipation of heat to the atmosphere.  
3. Artificial lakes are manmade  bodies of water which offer possible alternative. The heating    
    effluents are discharged into lake at one end and the water for cooling purpose may be     
    withdrawn from the other end  
3.1.7 NUCLEAR HAZARDS  
Radioactivity is the phenomenon of emission of energy from radioactive isotopes (i.e., unstable 
isotopes), such as Carbon -14, Uranium -235, Uranium -238, Uranium -239, Radium -226, etc. The 
emission of energy from radioactive substances in the environment is often called as 'Radioactive 
Polluti on'. 
Sources/causes of nuclear hazards  
The sources of radioactivity are both natural and man -made. The natural sources include:  
a) Natural sources:  
1) Emissions from radioactive materials from the Earth's crust.  
People have been exposed to low levels of ra diation from these natural sources for several 
millennia. But it is the man -made sources which are posing a threat to mankind.  
b) Man -Made Sources:  The man -made sources of radioactivity are nuclear wastes (i.e., waste 
material that contains radioactive nu clei) produced during the:  
1) Mining and processing of radioactive ores;  
2) Use of radioactive material in nuclear power plants;  
3) Use of radioactive isotopes in medical, industrial and research applications; and  
4) Use of radioactive materials in nuclear  weapons.  
The greatest exposure to human beings comes from the diagnostic use of X -rays, radioactive 
isotopes used as tracers and treatment of cancer and other ailments.  
Effects of nuclear hazards:  
The effects of radioactive pollutants depend upon half -life, energy releasing capacity, rate of 
diffusion and rate of deposition of the contaminant. Various atmospheric conditions and climatic 63 
 conditions such as wind, temperature and rainfall also determine their effects.  
The effects may be somatic (individual ex posed is affected) or genetic (future generations) 
damage. The effects are cancer, shortening of life span and genetic effects or mutations.  
 Some of the possible effects are listed as under:  
 
1) Radiations may break chemical bonds, such as DNA in cells. T his affects the genetic make -up 
and control mechanisms. The effects can be instantaneous, prolonged or delayed types. Even it 
could be carried to future generations.  
 
2) Exposure at low doses of radiations (100 -250 rads), men do not die but begin to suffer  from 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting and loss of hair. But recovery is possible.  
 
3) Exposure at higher doses (400 -500 rads), the bone marrow is affected, blood cells are reduced, 
natural resistance and fighting capacity against germs is reduced, blood fails to  clot, and the 
irradiated person soon dies of infection and bleeding.  
 
4) Higher irradiation doses (10,000 rads) kill the organisms by damaging the tissues of heart, 
brain, etc.  
 
5) Workers handling radioactive wastes get slow but continuous irradiation an d in course of time 
develop cancer of different types.6) Through food chain also, radioactivity effects are 
experienced by man.  
 
But the most significant effect of radioactivity is that it causes long range effects, affecting the 
future of man and hence th e future of our civilization.  
Control measures : 
On one hand, the peaceful uses of radioactive materials are so wide and effective that modern 
civilization cannot go without them; on the other hand, there is no cure for radiation damage. 
Thus the only optio n against nuclear hazards is to check and prevent radioactive pollution. For 
this: 
 
1) Leakages from nuclear reactors, careless handling, transport and use of radioactive fuels,          
fission products and radioactive isotopes have to be totally stopped;  
2) Safety measures should be enforced strictly;  
3) Waste disposal must be careful, efficient and effective;  
4) There should be regular monitoring and quantitative analysis through frequent sampling in     
the risk areas;  
5) Preventive measures should be f ollowed so that background radiation levels do not exceed  
the permissible limits;  64 
 6) Appropriate steps should be taken against occupational exposure; and  
7) Safety measures should be strengthened against nuclear accidents  
3.2 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT  
Solid wastes are the material that arises from various human and economic activities. It is being 
produced since the beginning of civilization. Ever increasing population growth, urbanization 
and industrialization are contributing to the generation of solid wast e in huge quantities.  
Waste is enviable; waste is by product of human activity which has lack of use. The term waste 
refers to the useless material generated from different sources such as household, public places, 
hospital, commercial centre construction sites and production of waste from industries.  
Waste can be classified through various methods on the basis of physical state (solid, liquid and 
gaseous) and then within solid waste (according to its original use packaging waste, food waste 
etc.) material (glass, paper etc.) physical properties, domestic, commercial, biodegradable, non -
biodegradable etc. Solid wastes have prevailing characteristics which sets them apart from the 
liquid and gaseous wastes.  
The characteristics are that the waste remains highly visible in the environment. Liquid wastes 
are quickly relegated to sewer and are out of sight and gaseous wastes disperse in to the 
atmosphere. Accumulation of large quantities of solid wastes is having an adverse impact on the 
environment.  
There are many waste types defined by modern systems of waste management, notably 
including:  
• municipal solid waste (MSW)  
• construction waste and demolition waste (C&D)  
• institutional waste, commercial waste, and industrial waste (IC&I)  
• medical waste (also kn own as clinical waste)  
• hazardous waste, radioactive waste, and electronic waste  
• biodegradable waste  
Waste management is the collection, transport, processing, recycling or disposal, and monitoring 
of waste materials. The term usually relates to materials p roduced by human activity, and is 
generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, the environment or aesthetics. Waste 
management is also carried out to recover resources from it. Waste management can involve 
solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive su bstances, with different methods an d fields of expertise for 
each.  
Effects  
a) Health Hazard  
If solid wastes are not collected and allowed to accumulate, they may create unsanitary 
conditions. This may lead to epidemic outbreaks. Many diseases like cholera , diarrhea, 
dysentery, plague, jaundice, or gastro -intestinal diseases may spread and cause loss of human 65 
 lives.  In addition, improper handling of the solid wastes is a health hazard for the workers who 
come in direct contact with the waste.  
b)Environmenta l Impact  
If the solid wastes are not treated properly, decomposition and putrefaction may take place, 
causing land and water pollution when the waste products percolate down into the underground 
water resources. The organic solid waste during decomposition  may generate obnoxious odors. 
Stray dogs and birds may sometimes invade garbage heaps and may spread it over the 
neighborhood causing unhygienic and unhealthy surroundings.  
Control measures  
An integrated waste management strategy includes three main comp onents  
1. Source reduction  
2. Recycling  
3. Disposal  
 Source reduction is one of the fundamental ways to reduce waste. This can be done by 
using less material when making a product, reuse of products on site, designing products or 
packaging to reduce their quantity. On an individual level we can reduce the use of unnecessary 
items while shopping, buy items with minimal packaging, avoid buying disposable items and 
also avoid asking for plastic carry bags .  
 Recycling is reusing some components of the waste that may have some economic value. 
Recycling has readily visible benefits such as conservation of resources reduction in energy used 
during manufacture and reducing pollution levels. Some materials such as aluminum and steel 
can be recycled many times. Metal, paper, glass and plastics are recyclable. Mining of new 
aluminum is expensive and hence recycled aluminum has a strong market and plays a significant 
role in the aluminum industry. Paper recycling can a lso help preserve forests as it takes about 17 
trees to make one ton of paper. Crushed glass (cullet) reduces the energy required to manufacture 
new glass by 50 percent. Cullet lowers the temperature requirement of the glassmaking process 
thus conserving e nergy and reducing air pollution.  
 However even if recycling is a viable alternative, it presents several problems. The 
problems associated with recycling are either technical or economical. Plastics are difficult to 
recycle because of the different types  of polymer resins used in their production. Since each type 
has its own chemical makeup different plastics cannot be recycled together. Thus separation of 
different plastics before recycling is necessary. Similarly in recycled paper the fibers are 
weakened and it is difficult to control the colour of the recycled prod uct. Recycled paper is 
banned for use in food containers to prevent the possibility of contamination. It very often costs 
less to transport raw paper pulp than scrap paper. Collection, sorting and transport account for 
about 90 percent of the cost of paper  recycling.  66 
  The processes of pulping, deinking and screening wastepaper are generally more 
expensive than making paper from virgin wood or cellulose fibers. Very often thus recycled 
paper is more expensive than virgin paper. However as technology improve s the cost will come 
down.  
 Disposal of solid waste is done most commonly through a sanitary landfill or through 
incineration. A modern sanitary landfill is a depression in an impermeable soil layer that is lined 
with an impermeable membrane. The three ke y characteristics of a municipal sanitary landfill 
that distinguish it from an open dump are:  
• Solid waste is placed in a suitably selected and prepared landfill site in a carefully prescribed 
manner.  
• The waste material is spread out and compacted with appropriate heavy machinery.  
• The waste is covered each day with a layer of compacted soil. The problems with older 
landfills are  associated with groundwater pollution. Pollutants seeping out from the bottom of a 
sanitary landfill (leachates) very often p ercolate down to the groundwater aquifer no matter how 
thick the underlying soil layer. Today it is essential to have suitable bottom liners and leachate 
collection systems along with the installation of monitoring systems to detect groundwater 
pollution.  
 The organic material in the buried solid waste will decompose due to the action of 
microorganisms. At first the waste decomposes aerobically until the oxygen that was present in 
the freshly placed fill is used up by the aerobic microorganisms. The anerobe s take over 
producing methane which is poisonous and highly explosive when mixed with air in 
concentrations between 5 and 15 percent. The movement of gas can be controlled by providing 
impermeable barriers in the landfill. A venting system to collect the b locked gas and vent it to 
the surface where it can be safely diluted and dispersed into the atmosphere is thus a necessary 
component of the design of sanitary landfills.  
 Even though land filling  is an economic alternative for solid waste disposal, it has  
become increasingly difficult to find suitable land filling  sites that are within economic hauling 
distance and very often citizens do not want landfills in their vicinity. Another reason is that no 
matter how well engineered the design and operation may be, there is always the danger of some 
environmental damage in the form of leakage of leachates. Incineration is the process of burning 
municipal solid waste in a properly designed furnace under suitable temperature and operating 
conditions. Incineration i s a chemical process in which the combustible portion of the waste is 
combined with oxygen forming carbon dioxide and water, which are released into the 
atmosphere.  
 This chemical reaction called oxidation results in the release of heat. For complete 
oxidation the waste must be mixed with appropriate volumes of air at a temperature of about 
815o C for about one hour.  67 
  Incineration can reduce the municipal solid waste by about 90 percent in volume and 75 
percent in weight. The risks of incineration however  involve airquality problems and toxicity and 
disposal of the fly and bottom ash produced during the incineration process. Fly ash consists of 
finely divided particulate matter, including cinders, mineral dust and soot. Most of the 
incinerator ash is botto m ash while the remainder is fly ash. The possible presence of heavy 
metals in incinerator ash can be harmful. Thus toxic products and materials containing heavy 
metals (for example batteries and plastics) should be segregated.  
 Thus extensive air pollutio n control equipment and high -level technical supervision and 
skilled employees for proper operation and maintenance is required. Thus while sanitary landfills 
and incinerators have their own advantages and disadvantages, the most effective method of 
solid waste management is source reduction and recycling.  
Vermi – Composting  
 Nature has perfect solutions for managing the waste it creates, if left undisturbed. The 
biogeochemical cycles are designed to clear the waste material produced by animals and plants. 
We can mimic the same methods that are present in nature. All dead and dry leaves and twigs 
decompose and are broken down by organisms such as worms and insects, and is finally broken 
down by bacteria and fungi, to form a dark rich soil -like material calle d compost.  
 These organisms in the soil use the organic material as food, which provides them with 
nutrients for their growth and activities. These nutrients are returned to the soil to be used again 
by trees and other plants. This process recycles nutrie nts in nature. This soil can be used as a 
manure for farms and gardens.  
 
3.2.1 ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS IN PREVENTION OF POLLUTION  
 
The role of an individual in maintaining a pollution free, pure and congenial environment and in 
preserving its resources is act ually the need of the hour. Individuals can, however, play an 
important role in abatement of air, water, soil or noise pollution in the following  simple 
manners:  
 
1) Use low -phosphate, phosphate -free or biodegradable dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent,   
and shampoo.  
2) Don't use water fresheners in toilets.  
3) Use manure or compost instead of commercial inorganic fertilizers to fertilize gardens and    
yard plant.  
4) Use biological methods or integrated pest management to control garden, yard, an d    
    household pests.  
5) Don't pour pesticides, paints, solvents, oils, or other produc ts containing harmful chemicals 
down  drain or on the ground. Contact the authorities responsible for their disposal.  
6) Recycle old motor oil and antifreeze at an auto service c enter that has an oil recycling 
program  68 
 7) If you get water from a private well or suspect that municipal water is contaminated, have  
    tested by an EPA certified laboratory for lead, nitrates, trihalomethanes, radon, volatile,    
    organic compounds and pesticides.  
8) Run water from taps f or several minutes every morning before using the water for drinking  
     or cooking. Save it and use it to water plants.  
    If you have a septic tank, monitor it yearly and have it cleaned out every three to five years   
      by a reputable contractor so that it won’t contribute to groundwater pollution. Do not use  
      Septic  tank cleaner, which contain toxic chemicals that can kill bacteria important to sewage  
      Decomposition  and that can contaminate groundwater if systems malfunction.  
9) Suppo rt ecological land -use planning in your community.  
10) Get to know your local water bodies and form watchdog groups to help monitor, protect,  
and restore them.  
 
3.3 DISASTER MANAGEMENT  
Disaster means a terrible event that causes a great damage / loss to the human beings. It is a 
situation arising from natural forces where large scale disruption of infrastructure, services etc. 
occurs. It causes a serious impact on human life, economy and  environment. Natural disasters are 
always severe and sudden.  
 
Some disasters are:  
(A) Geological: in nature like the earthquakes;  
(B) Landslides (rocks slides down from the side of a hill ); Volcanic eruptions etc..  
(C) Climatic disasters / Natural calam ities: These are of different types affect nations all over the    
      world. Because of the large geographical size of the country, India often faces natural   
      calamities like floods, cyclones and drought occurring frequently in different parts of  the  
      country.  
     Natural calamities are of two types:  
1. Major calamities: eg: earthquakes; droughts; floods, tsunamis; cyclones etc  
2. Minor calamities: eg: hailstorms; avalanches; fire accidents  
(D) Man induced disasters include wars, battles, riots, rail/road accidents, nuclear explosions.  
 
The disaster Management : The natural disaster management involves the following steps:  
Relief measures: it include rescue tools; communication equipments; heavy machines to remove 
debris; water pump s; technicians; drugs, doctors, ambulances..  
 
Disaster predictions : The predictions of natural hazards may be made on the basis of past 
history of the area with regular monitoring of the environmental changes caused by human 
activities to assess the genesi s of natural disasters.  
 
Education: Disaster education plays a significant role in disaster education. It create awareness 
and improve the standards to prevent from the disasters.  
Geographic Information Systems: (GIS): GIS is a system that captures, stores , analyzes , 
manages and presents data with reference to geographic location of the area. In simple terms, 
GIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis and database technology. GIS may be used 
in Archaeology, Geography, Remote Sensing, Land surv eying; Natural Resource Management;  69 
 Urban Planning etc. GIS programs help by means of maps available data of the problem areas, to 
predict the severity of the disaster.  
 
Floods  
Floods are high stream flow that overflows the natural banks of the rivers and most of the times 
become calamitous. India is the most flood affected nation after Bangladesh. Out of total deaths 
by Floods in the world, (1/5) are from India. The main causes o f floods are excessive rains in 
river catchments, poor natural drai nage, Change of river course, Landslide restricting river flow, 
cyclone  and very intense  rainfall. Over that past few years the rise in population is forcing large 
settlements along the river banks, making the country highly  vulnerable to Floods. The most 
vulnerable states of India are Uttar Pradesh , Bihar, Assam, West Bengal , Gujarat, Orissa , Andhra 
Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra , and PunjabandJammu &Kashmir. In 1994, a major flood 
killed 147 people in Kerala, 138 in Gujarat and marooned 10000 in Madh ya Pradesh. In 1995, 
the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh were severely  hit by flood  causing  
huge  casualties . In the year 1996, a fierce flood literally paralyzed India, Thousands of people 
died, got homeless, were marooned in the sta tes of Rajasthan , Andhra Pradesh, Jammu & 
Kashmir also affecting many other parts of the country. In short, nearly every year one or the 
other part of the country is severely hit by Floods and creating a shameful history for India. It is 
high time that the  policies and measures for various preventions and disaster management  
activities are properly implemented. Development of flood risk maps, flash flood run off 
modeling, water logging problems, systems for monitoring and management of flood using 
remote sensing and GIS.  
Earth -quakes  Earthquakes occur due to the sudden movements in the earth crust. The earth’s 
crust has several tectonic plates of solid rocks which slowly move along their boundaries. When 
friction prevents these plates from slipping,  stress builds up and results in the sudden fractures 
which occur along their boundaries of the plates or fault lines (planes of weakness) within the 
plates. This causes earthquakes, the violent, short term vibrations in the earth. The point on a 
fault at which the first movement occurs during an earth quake is called the epicenter. The 
severity of an earthquake is generally  measured  by its magnitude  on RichterScale.  
        Richter scale                                                     Severity of earthq uake  
            Less than  4                                                         Insignificant  
               4-4.9          Minor  
    5-5.9                                Damaging  
    6-6.9              Destructive   
    7-7.9            Major  
               8-8.9                                                                 Great  
 
 Damage to property and life can be prevented by  monitoring of buildings and structures under 
Strong Earth Motion, experimental and analytical investigations on str uctures to predict their 
behavior  under earthquake conditions, strengthening through retrofits, development of 70 
 earthquake resistant design methodologies, better materials, risk assessment, preparation of 
seismic codes, seismic zonation and development of r isk specific designs  
Landslides  
Landslides are mass movement of rocks and debris that usually follow a cyclone, volcano or 
earthquake. In the hilly areas of India, the sliding of huge masses of land has been a common 
natural disaster causing havoc to life and property. One o f the worst and most disastrous 
landslides  has been recorded in the year 1998 in the state of Uttarakhand, when nearly 380 
people were killed. As a measure of concern many committees and other measures have been 
taken to protect from thi s natural havoc in India. In India, the regions of Himalayas and the 
Western ghats are the most vu lnerable to these land -slides. The main causes of landslides are 
weak, weathered materials, physical property variation, Ground Uplift, erosion, Earthquake, 
Volcanic eruptions etc. The general and simple mitigation that are adopted or should be adopted 
are drainage correction, proper land -utilization, reforestation and spreading of awareness.  
Cyclones  
Cyclone refers to a whirl in the atmosphere with very strong winds circulating around it in anti -
clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Cyclones are intense low pressure areas with pressure increasing outwards. Cyclones can be 
hazardous as Cyclones are normall y associated with strong winds. A storm surge is an abnormal 
rise of sea level near the coast caused by a severe tropical cyclone; as a result, sea water 
inundates low lying areas of coastal regions drowning human beings and lives - stock, eroding 
beaches a nd embankments, destroying vegetation and reducing soil fertility. Apart from strong 
winds, cyclones can result in heavy rains causing floods. However, the most destructive factor 
associated with the cyclones is the storm surge. The worst and the oldest cy clone in India were in 
1737, in Calcutta that t ook 300000 lives respectively. For cyclone forecast and advance warning, 
the Government has strengthened the Meteorological Department, by providing Cyclone 
Surveillance Radars at Calcutta, Paradeep, Visakhapa tnam, Machilipatnam, Madras and Karaikal 
in the east coast and at Cochin, Goa, Bombay and Bhuj in the west coast. As India has a vast 
coastline it is extremely vulnerable to cyclone.

 71 
 MANAGEMENT OF E -WASTES  
It is estimated that 75% of electronic items are stored due to uncertainty of how to manage it. 
These electronic junks lie unattended in houses, offices, warehouses etc. and normally mixed 
with household wastes, which are finally disposed off at landfills.  This necessitates 
implementable management measures.  
In industries management of e -waste should begin at the point of generation. This can be done by 
waste minimization techniques and by sustainable product design. Waste minimization in 
industries involv es adopting:  
• inventory management,  
• production -process modification,  
• volume reduction,  
• Recovery  and reuse.  
Inventory management  
Proper control over the materials used in the manufacturing process is an important way to 
reduce waste generation (Freeman, 1989). By reducing both the quantity of hazardous  
Materials  used in the process and the amount of excess raw materials in stock, the quantity of 
waste generated can be reduced. This can be done in two ways i.e. establishing material -purchase 
review and control procedures and inventory tracking system.  
Another inventory management procedure for waste reduction is to ensure that only the needed 
quantity of a material is ordered. This will require the establishment of a strict inventory t racking 
system. Purchase procedures must be implemented which ensure that materials are ordered only 
on an as -needed basis and that only the amount needed for a specific period of time is ordered.  
 
Production -process modification  
Changes can be made in t he production process, which will reduce waste generation. This 
reduction can be accomplished by changing the materials used to make the product or by the 
more efficient use of input materials in the production process or both. Potential waste 
minimization  techniques can be broken down into three categories:  
i) Improved operating and maintenance procedures,  
ii) Material change and  
iii) Process -equipment modification.  
 
Volume reduction  
Volume reduction includes those techniques that remove the hazardous  portion of a waste from a 
non-hazardous portion. These techniques are usually to reduce the volume, and thus the cost of 
disposing of a waste material. The techniques that can be used to reduce waste -stream volume 
can be divided into 2 general categories:  source segregation and waste concentration. 
Segregation of wastes is in many cases a simple and economical technique for waste reduction. 
Wastes containing different types of metals can be treated separately so that the metal value in 
the sludge can be re covered. Concentration of a waste stream may increase the likelihood that the 
material can be recycled or reused. Methods include gravity and vacuum filtration, ultra 
filtration, reverse osmosis, freeze vaporization etc.  
For example, an electronic compone nt manufacturer can use compaction equipments to reduce 
volume of waste cathode ray -tube.  72 
  
Recovery and reuse  
This technique could eliminate waste disposal costs, reduce raw material costs and provide 
income from a salable waste. Waste can be recovered o n-site, or at an off -site recovery facility, 
or through inter industry exchange. A number of physical and chemical techniques are available 
to reclaim a waste material such as reverse osmosis, electrolysis, condensation, electrolytic 
recovery, filtration, centrifugation etc. For example, a printed -circuit board manufacturer can use 
electrolytic recovery to reclaim metals from copper and tin -lead plating bath.  
However recycling of hazardous products has little environmental benefit if it simply moves the 
hazards into secondary products that eventually have to be disposed of. Unless the goal is to 
redesign the product to use non hazardous materials, such recycling is a false solution.  
Sustainable product design  
Minimization of hazardous wastes should be at product design stage itself keeping in mind the 
following factors*  
• Rethink the product design:  Efforts should be made to design a product with fewer 
amounts of hazardous materials. For example, the efforts to reduce material use are 
reflected in some ne w computer designs that are flatter, lighter and more integrated. 
Other companies propose centralized networks similar to the telephone system.  
• Use of renewable materials and energy:  Bio-based plastics are plastics made with 
plant -based chemicals or plant -produced polymers rather than from petro chemicals. Bio -
based toners, glues and inks are used more frequently. Solar computers also exist but they 
are currently very expensive.  
• Use of non -renewable materials that are safer: Because many of the materials used are 
non-renewable, designers could ensure the product is built for re -use, repair and/or 
upgradeability. Some computer manufacturers such as Dell and Gateway lease out their 
products thereby ensuring they get them back to further upgrade and lease out  again.  
3.3.2 PLASTICS WASTE MANAGEMENT  
 
 Environmental Issues and Challenges  
 
The quantum of solid waste is ever increasing due to increase in population, developmental 
activities, changes in life style, and socio -economic conditions, Plastics waste is a significant 
portion of the total municipal solid waste (MSW).  
It is estimated that approximately 10 thousand tons per day (TPD) of plastics waste is generated 
i.e. 9% of 1.20 lacs TPD of MSW in the country.  
 
The plastics waste constitutes two major categories  of plastics;  
(i) Thermoplastics:  Thermoplastics, constitutes 80% and thermos et constitutes 
approximately 20% of total post -consumer plastics waste generated in India. The 
Thermoplastics are recyclable plastics.  
Eg: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Low Density Poly Ethylene (LDPE), Poly 
Vinyal Chloride ( PVC), High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE), Polypropylene ( PP), 
Polystyrene (PS) etc.  73 
 (ii)  Thermoset plastics: Thermoset plastics contains alkyd, epoxy, ester, melamine 
formaldehyde, phenolic formaldehyde, silicon, urea formaldehyde, polyurethane, 
metalised and multilayer plastics etc.  
The environmental hazards due to mismanagement of plastics waste include the following 
aspects:  
❯Littered plastics spoil  beauty of the ci ty and choke drains and make important public     
Places  filthy;  
❯ Garbage containing plastics, when burnt may cause air pollution by emitting polluting    
     Gases ; 
❯ Garbage mixed with plastics interferes in waste processing facility and may also cause     
    Problems  in landfill operations;  
❯ Recycling industries operating in non -conforming areas are posing unhygienic   
     Problems  to the environment.  
 
Main Features of the Plastics Manufacture and Usage(Amendment) Rules, 2003  
 
Regulation of plastics waste, particularly manufacture and use of recycled plastics carry bags and 
containers is being regulated in the country as per “Recycled Plastics Manufacture and Usage 
Rules, 1999 and as amended in 2003. According to these Rules:

plastic bags which are less than 8 x 12 inches in size and having thickness less than 20 microns.  
 
2. No vendor shall use carry bags/containers made of recycled plast ics for storing, carrying, 
dispensing or packaging of food stuffs  
 
3. Carry bags and containers made of recycled plastic and used for purposes other than storing    
    and packaging food stuffs shall be manufactured using pigments and colorants as per IS    
    9833:1981 entitled “List of pigments and colorants for use in plastics in contact with food  
    stuffs, pharmaceuticals and drinking water”

 74 
  
Options for Plastic Waste Management  
 
Recycling of plastics through environmentally sound manne r: 
 
Recycling of plastics should be carried in such a manner to minimize the pollution during the 
process and as a result to enhance the efficiency of the process and conserve the energy. Plastics 
recycling technologies have been historically divided into four general types -primary, 
secondary, tertiary and q uaternary.  
• Primary recycling involves processing of a waste/scrap into a product with 
characteristics similar to those of original product.  
• Secondary recycling involves processing of waste/scrap plastics into materials that have 
characteristics different f rom those of original plastics product.  
• Tertiary recycling involves the production of basic chemicals and fuels from plastics 
waste/scrap as part of the municipal waste stream or as a segregated waste.  
• Quaternary recycling retrieves the energy content of w aste/scrap plastics by burning / 
incineration. This process is not in use in India.  
 
Steps Involved in the Recycling Process  
 
1.Selection: The recyclers / reprocessors have to select the waste / scrap which are suitable for 
recycling /reprocessing.  
2.Segre gation: The plastics waste shall be segregated as per the Codes 1 -7 mentioned  
3.Processing: After selection and segregation of the pre -consumer waste (factory waste) shall be 
directly recycled. The post consumer waste (used plastic waste) shall be washed, shredded, 
agglomerated, extruded and granulated  
 
Polymer Coated Bitumen Road  
The CPCB has undertaken a project in collaboration with Thiagarajar College of Engineering 
Madurai to evaluate the performance of polymer coated built roads laid during 2002 -2006 in 
different cities.  
The observations are as below:  
• The coating of plastics over aggregate improves Impact, Los Angels Abrasion and 
Crushing Value with the increase in the percentage of plastics.  
•  The extracted bitumen showed almost near value for Marshall stability.  
• The entire road was having good skid resistance and texture values.  
• All the stretches in the roads have been found reasonably strong.  
• The unevenness index values of these roads are nea rly 3000 mm/km, which indicate a 
good surface evenness.  
• The plastic tar roads have not developed any potholes, rutting, raveling or edge flaw, 
even though these roads are more than four years of age.  
• Polymer coated aggregate bitumen mix performs well compa red to polymer modified 
bitumen mix.  
• Higher percentage of polymer coating improves the binding strength of the mix.  
• Foam plastics have better binding values.

 3.4 WATER CONSERVATION  
Water being one of the most precious and indispensable resources needs to be conserved . The 
following strategies can be adopted for conservation of water.  
 
1. Decreasing run -off losses:  Huge water -loss occurs due to run -off on most of  the soils, which 
can be reduced by allowing most of the water to infiltrate into the soil .  
This can be achieved by using contour cultivation, terrace framing, water  spreading, chemical 
treatment or improved water -storage system.  
a) Contour cultivation: on small furrows and ri dges across the slopes trap rainwater  and  
allow more time for infiltration. Terracing constructed on deep soils have large water - 
storage capacity. On gentle slopes trapped run off is spread over a large area for  
better infiltration  
b) Conservation -bench terracing: It involves construction of a series of benches for  
catching the runoff  water.  
c) Water spreading is done by channeling or lagoon -leveling, In channeling, the water  
flow is controlled by a series of diversions with vertic al intervals. In lagoon leveling,  
small depressions are dug in the area so that there is temporary storage water  
d) Chemical wetting agents (Surfactants): These seem to increase the water  intake rates  
when added to normal irrigated soil.  
e) Surface crop residues, tillage, mulch, animal residues etc. help in reducing  run-off by  
allowing more time for water to penetrate into the land.  
f) Chemical conditioners like gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) when applied to sodic soils  
improve soil permeability and reduce run off.  Another useful conditioner is  
HPAN(hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile)  
g) Water -storage structures like farm ponds, dug -outs etc. build by individual farmers   
can be useful measures for conserving water through reduction of runoff.  
 
2. Reducing evaporation los ses: This is more relevant in humid regions. Horizontal  barriers of 
asphalt placed below the soil surface increase water  availability and increase crop yield by 35 -
40%. This is more effective on sandy  soil but less effective on loamy sand soils. A  co-polym er of 
starch and acrylonitrile called ‘super slumper’ has been reported to  absorb water up to 1400 
times its weight. The chemical has been found to be  useful for sandy soils.  
3. Storing water in soil: Storage of water takes place in the soil root zone in humed  regions when 
the soil is wetted to field capacity. By leaving the soil fallow for  one season water can be made 
available for the crop grown in next season.  
4. Reducing  irrigation losses:  
a) Use of lined or covered canals to reduce seepage  
b) Irrigation in early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation losses  
c) Sprinkling irrigation and drip irrigation to conserve water by 30 -50%  
d) Growing hybrid crop varieties with less water requirements and tolerance to saline  
Water  help conserve water.  
5. Reuse  of water:  
a) Treated wastewater can be used for ferti -irrigation  
b) Using grey water from washings, bath -tubs etc. for watering gardens, washing cars  
or paths help in saving fresh water.  
 
6. Preventing wastage of water:  This can be done in households, commercial buildings and 
public places.  76 
 a) Closing taps when not in use  
b) Repairing any  leakage from pipes  
c) Using small capacity flush in toilets.  
7. Increasing block pricing:  The consumer has to pay a proportionately higher bi ll with higher 
use of water. This helps in economic use of water by the consumer  
 
3.4.1 RAIN WATER HARVESTING  
 
Introduction:  
The term rainwater harvesting is being frequently used these days, however, the concept of water 
harvesting is not new for India. Water harvesting techniques had been evolved and developed 
centuries ago.  
Ground water resource gets naturally recharged through percolation. But due to indiscriminate 
development and rapid urbanization, exposed surface for soil has been reduced dra stically with 
resultant reduction in percolation of rainwater, thereby depleting ground water resource. 
Rainwater harvesting is the process of augmenting the natural filtration of rainwater in to the 
underground formation by some artificial methods. "Consc ious collection and storage of 
rainwater to cater to demands of water, for drinking, domestic purpose & irrigation is termed as 
Rainwater Harvesting.  
 
   Why to harvest rain water?  
▪ To arrest ground water decline and augment ground water table  
▪ To beneficiate water quality in aquifers  
▪ To conserve surface water runoff during monsoon  
▪ To reduce soil erosion  
▪ To inculcate a culture of water conservation  
 
Rainwater harvesting can be harvested from the following surfaces:  
Rooftops:  If buildings with impervious roofs are already in place, the catchment area is 
effectively available free of charge and they provide a supply at the point of 
consumption.  
Paved and unpaved areas  i.e., landscapes, open fields, parks, storm water drains, ro ads 
and pavements and other open areas can be effectively used to harvest the runoff. The 
main advantage in using ground as collecting surface is that water can be collected from a 
larger area. This is particularly advantageous in areas of low rainfall.  
Water bodies : The potential of lakes, tanks and ponds to store rainwater is immense. The 
harvested rainwater can not only be used to meet water requirements of the city, it also 
recharges groundwater aquifers.  
Storm water  drains:  Most of the residential co lonies have proper network of storm 
water drains. If maintained neatly, these offer a simple and cost effective means for 
harvesting rainwater.  
 
Types of Harvesting System  
Broadly rainwater can be harvested for two purposes  
A. Roof top rain water harvesting (RTRWH)  
B. Charged into the soil for withdrawal later (groundwater recharging)  
A. Roof top rain water harvesting (RTRWH)  77 
  
It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the 
catchments, and the rainwater  is collected from the roof of the house/building. It can either be 
stored  in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system. This method is less expensive and very 
effective and if implemented properly helps in augmenting the ground water level of the a rea. 
 
Components of Roof top Rainwater harvesting system:  
 
 
The system mainly constitutes of following sub components :  
• Catchment,  Coarse mesh, Gutters, Conduits or Conveyance  
• Transportation  
• First flush  
• Filter  
• Storage  
• Supply unit  
 
The system mainly constitutes of following sub components :  
• Catchment,  Coarse mesh, Gutters, Conduits or Conveyance  
• Transportation  
• First flush  
• Filter  
• Storage  
• Supply unit  
.   
1. Catchments:  The catchment of a water harvesting system is the surface which 
directly receives the rainfall and provides water to the system. It can be a paved area like 
a terrace or courtyard of a building, or an unpaved area like a lawn or open ground. A 
roof made o f reinforced cement concrete (RCC), galvanized  iron or corrugated sheets 
can also be used for water harvesting.  
78 
 2. Coarse mesh: Present at the corners of the 
roof to prevent the passage of debris  
 
3.Gutters:  
Channels all around the edge of a sloping roof 
to collect and transport rainwater to the storage 
tank. Gutters can be semi -circular or 
rectangular and could be made using:  
▪ Locally available material such as plain galvanized iron sheet (20 to 22 gau ge), 
folded to required shapes.  
▪ Semi -circular gutters of PVC material can be readily prepared by cutting those 
pipes into two equal semi -circular channels.  
▪ Bamboo or betel trunks cut vertically in half.  
The size of the gutter should be according to the flow during the highest intensity rain. It 
is advisable to make them 10 to 15 per cent oversize.  
Gutters need to be supported so they do not sag or fall off when loaded with water. The 
way in which gutters are fixed depends on the construction of the house; it is possible to 
fix iron or t imber brackets into the walls, but for houses having wider eaves, some 
method of attachment to the rafters is necessary.  
4 Conduits or Conveyance:  
Conduits are pipelines or drains that carry rainwater from the catchment or rooftop area 
to the harvesting sy stem. Conduits can be of any material like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
or galvanized iron (GI), materials that are commonly available.  
. 
5. First -flushing  
A first flush device is a valve that ensures that runoff from the first spell of rain is 
flushed out an d does not enter the system. This needs to be done since the first spell of 
rain carries a relatively larger amount of pollutants from the air and catchment surface.  
 
6. Filtration or Purification:  
The filter is used to remove suspended pollutants from rainwater collected over roof. A 
filter unit is a chamber filled with filtering media such as fiber, coarse sand and gravel 
layers to remove debris and dirt from water before it enters the storage tank or recharges 
structure. Charcoal can b e added for additional filtration.  
(i)Charcoal water filter: A simple charcoal filter can be made in a drum or an earthen 
pot. The filter is made of gravel, sand and charcoal, all of which are easily available.  
  
 
 
(ii) Sand filters  
Sand filters have commonly available sand as filter media. Sand filters are easy and 
inexpensive to construct. These filters can be employed for treatment of water to 
effectively remove turbidity (suspended particles like silt and clay), colour and

urban areas  
79 
 microorganisms.  
In a simple sand filter that can be constructed domestically, the top layer comprises 
coarse sand followed by a 5 -10 mm layer of gravel followed by another 5 -25 cm layer of 
gravel and boulders.  
 
7. Storage or Sump:  A storage provision to collect filtered water from the tank through 
the filter chan nel for storage and collection.  
There are various options available for the construction of these tanks with respect to the 
shape, size and the material of construction.  
Shape:  Cylindrical, rectangular and square.  
Material of construction : Reinforced cem ent concrete, (RCC), ferrocement, masonry, 
plastic (polyethylene) or metal ( galvanized  iron) sheets are commonly used.  
Position of tank:  Depending on space availability these tanks could be constructed 
above ground, partly underground or fully underground. Some maintenance measures 
like cleaning and disinfection are required to ensure the quality of water stored in the 
container.  
 
B. Charged into the soil for withdrawal later (groundwater recharging)  
Ground water aquifers can be recharged by various kinds of structures to ensure 
percolation of rainwater in the ground instead of draining away from the surface. 
Commonly used recharging m ethods are:   
a) Recharging of bore wells                   
b) Recharging of dug wells.  
c) Recharge pits                                      
d) Recharge Trenches  
e) Soak ways or Recharge Shafts       
f) Percolation Tanks  
a) Recharging of bore wells   
Rainwater collected from rooftop of the building is diverted through drainpipes to 
settlement or filtration tank. After settlement filtered water is diverted to bore wells to 
recharge deep aquifers. Abandoned bore wells can also be used for recharge.  
Optimum capacit y of settlement tank/filtration tank can be designed on the basis of area 
of catchments , inte nsity of rainfall and recharge rate as discussed in design parameters. 
While recharging, entry of floating matter and silt should be restricted because it may 
clog the recharge structure. "first one or two shower should be flushed out through   rain 
separator to avoid contamination. This is very important, and all care should be taken to 
ensure that this has been done."  80 
  
b) Recharge pits  
Recharge pits are small pits  of any shape rectangular, square or circular, contracted with 
brick or stone masonry wall with weep hole at regular intervals, top of the pit can be 
covered with perforated covers. Bottom of pit should be filled with filter media  
The capacity of the pit c an be designed on the basis of catchment area, rainfall intensity 
and recharge rate of soil. Usually the dimensions of the pit may be of 1 to 2 m width and 
2 to 3 m deep depending on the depth of pervious strata. These pits are suitable for 
recharging of s hallow aquifers, and small houses.  
 
 
c)soak away or recharge shaft  
Soak away or recharge shafts are provided where upper layer of  soil is alluvial or less 
pervious. These are bored hole of 30 cm dia. up to 10 to 15 m deep, depending on depth 
of pervious layer. Bore should be lined with slotted/perforated PVC/MS pipe to prevent 
collapse of the vertical sides. At the top of soak away required size sump is constructed 
to retain runoff before the filters through soak away. Sump should be filled with filter 
media.  
 
 
81 
  
d)Recharging of dug well  
Dug well can be used as recharge structure. Rainwater from the rooftop is diverted to 
dug wells after passing it through filtration bed. Cleaning and desalting of dug well 
should be done regularly  to enhance the r echarge rate. The filtration method suggested 
for bore well recharging could be used  
 
 
e) Recharge trenches  
Recharge trench in provided where upper impervious layer of  soil is shallow. It is a 
trench excavated on the ground and refilled with porous media like pebbles, boulder or 
brickbats. It is usually made for harvesting the surface runoff. Bore wells can also be 
provided inside the trench as recharge shafts to enhance percolation. The length of the 
trench is decided as per the amount of runoff exp ected. This method is suitable for small 
houses, playgrounds, parks and roadside drains. The recharge trench can be of size 0.50 
to1.0mwideand1.0to1.5mdeep.  
  
 
f) Percolation tanks  
Percolation tanks are artificially created surface water bodies, submerging a land area 
with adequate permeability to facilitate sufficient percolation to recharge the ground 
water. These can be built in big campuses where land is available and topography is 
suitable. Surface  run-off and roof top water can be diverted to this tank. Water 
82 
 accumulating in the tank percolates in the solid to augment the ground water. The stored 
water can be used directly for gardening and raw use. Percolation tanks should be built in 
gardens, ope n spaces and roadside green belts of urban area.  
 
  
 
3.4.2 WATERSHED MANAGEMENT  
 
Introduction:  
The land area drained by a river is known as the river basin. The watershed is defined as the land 
area from which water drains under gravity to a common drainage channel. Thus watershed is a 
delineated area with a well defined topographic boundary and one  water outlet. The watershed 
can range from a few square kilometers to few thousand square kilometers in size.  
 
In the watershed the hydrological conditions are such that water becomes concentrated within a 
particular location like a river or a reservoir,  by which the watershed is drained. The watershed 
comprises complex interactions of soil, landform, vegetation, land use activities and water. 
People and animals are an integral part of a watershed having mutual impacts on each other. We 
may live anywhere we would be living in some watershed. A watershed affects as it is directly 
involved in sustained food production, water  supply for irrigation, power generation, and 
transportation  as well as for influencing sedimentation and erosion, vegetation growth, floods 
and droughts. Thus management of watersheds treating them as a basic functional unit is 
extremely important and the first such Integrated Watershed Management was adopted in 1 949 
by the Damodar Valley Corporation.  
 
Watershed degradation:  
The watersheds are very often found to be degraded due to uncontrolled, unplanned and 
unscientific land use activities. Organizing, deforestation, mining, construction activities, 
industrialization, shifting cultivation, natural and artificial fires, soil erosion and ignorance of 
local people have been responsible for degradation of various watersheds.  
 
Objectives of Watershed Management:  
Rational utilization of land and water  sourc es for optimum production causing minimum damage 
to the natural resources is known as watershed management.  
The objectives of watershed management are as follows:  
1. To rehabilitate the watershed through proper land use adopting conservation strategies fo r 
minimizing soil erosion and moisture retention so as to ensure good productivity of the land for 
the farmers.  
2. To manage the watershed for beneficial developmental activities like domestic water supply, 
irrigation, hydropower generation etc.  
3. To mini mize the risks of floods, droughts and landslides . 
4. To develop rural areas in the region with clear plans for improving the economy of the 
regions.  
 
Watershed management practices:  
In the fifth year plan, watershed management approach was included with a  number of programs 
for it and a national policy was developed. In watershed management the aspects of  development 
are considered with regard to availability of the resources.  83 
 The practices of conservation and development of land and water are taken up wit h respect to 
their suitability for people’s benefit as well as sustainability.  
Various measures taken up for management include the following:  
1. Water harvesting:  Proper storage of water is done with provision for use in dry seasons in 
low rainfall areas . It also helps in moderation of floods.  
2. Afforestation and agro -forestry:  In watershed development, afforestation and crop 
plantation play a very important role. They help to prevent soil erosion and retention of moisture. 
In high rainfall areas, woody trees are grown in between crops to substantially reduce the runoff 
and loss of fertile soil. In Dehradun trees like Eucalyptus, Leucaena and grasses like 
chrysopogon are grown along with maize or wheat to achieve the objectives. Woody trees grown 
successf ully in such agro -forestry programs include Sheesham, Teak and Keekar which have 
been used in watershed areas of river Yamuna.  
3. Mechanical measures for reducing soil erosion and runoff losses : Several mechanical 
measures like terracing, bunding, bench te rracing, no -till farming, contour cropping, strip 
cropping etc. are used to minimize runoff and soil erosion particularly on the slopes of 
watersheds. Bunding has proved to be a very useful method in reducing runoff, peak discharge 
and soil loss in Dehradu n andSiwaliks  
4. Scientific mining and quarrying:  Due to improper mining, the hills lose stability and get 
disturbed resulting in landslides, rapid erosion etc. Contour trenching a tan interval of one meter 
on overburdened dump, planting some soil binding plants land draining of water courses in the 
mined area are recommended for  minimizing the destructive effects of mining in watershed 
areas.  
5. Public participation:  People’s involvement including the farmers and tribals  is the key to the 
success of any w atershed management program, particularly the soil and water conservation. 
People’s cooperation as well as participation has to be ensured for the same.  
 
3.4.3 RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE  
 
Problems and concerns:  Economic development raises the quality and standard of living of the 
people of a country. Developmental projects are planned to bring benefits to the society. 
However, in the process of development, very often there is over -exploitation of natural 
resour ces and degradation of the environment. Besides this, quite often, the native people of the 
project site are directly affected. These native people are generally the poorest of the poor, 
underprivileged tribal people. Various types of projects result in th e displacement of the native 
people who undergo tremendous economic and psychological distress, as the socioeconomic and 
ecological base of the local community is disturbed.  
 
a) Displacement problems due to dams :   
   The big river valley projects have one  of the most serious socio -economic impacts due to large 
scale displacement of  local people from their ancestral home and loss of their traditional 84 
 profession or  occupation. India is one of the countries in the world leading in big dam 
construction and in the last 50 years more than 20 million people are estimated o have directly or 
indirectly affected by these dams e.g. Hirakum Dam, Bhakra Nangal Dam, Tehri Dam are the 
examples where many people and their villages in the vicinity got affected. It also resu lted in 
movement lead by Sunderlal Bahuguna - movement called Chipko Movement - One more stir is 
currently on is Sardar Sarovar Project - three states people and many villages get affected.  
 
b) Displacement due to mining:  
Mining is another developmental activ ity, which causes displacement of the native people. 
Several thousands of hectares of land area is covered in mining operation and the native people 
are displaced. Sometimes displacement of local people is due to accidents occurring in mined 
areas like sub sidence of land that often leads to shifting people e.g. various mines are 
predominant in Jharkhand, these mines had displaced many people.  
 
c) Displacement due to creation of National park  : 
 When some forests are covered under a National Park, it is a we lcome step for conservation of 
the natural resources. However, it also has a social aspect associated with it which is often 
neglected. A major portion of the forest is declared as core -area, where the entry of local 
dwellers or tribals is prohibited. When  these villagers are deprived of their ancestral right or 
access to forests, they usually retaliate by starting destructive activities. There is a need to look 
into their problems and provide them some employment  
 
REHABILITATION ISSUES:  
 
The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights has declared that right to housing is 
a basic human right. In India, most of the displacements have resulted due to land acquisition by 
the government for various reasons. For this purpose, the gover nment has the Land Acquisition 
Act, 1894 which empowers it to serve notice to the people to vacate their lands if there is a need 
as per government planning. Provision of cash compensation in lieu of the land vacated exists in 
the Act.  
The major issues re lated to displacement and rehabilitation are as follows:  
a) Tribals are usually the most affected amongst the displaced who are already poor. 
Displacement further increases their poverty due to loss of land, home,  jobs, food insecurity, loss 
of access to c ommon property assets, increased morbidity and mortality and social isolation.  
b) Break up of families in an important social issue arising due to displacement in which the 
women are the worst affected and they are not even given cash/land compensation.  
c) The tribals are not familiar with the market policies and trends. Even if they get cash 
compensation, they get alienated in the modern economic set up.  
d) The land acquisition laws ignore the communal ownership of property, which is an inb uilt 
system amongst the tribals. Thus the tribals lose their communitarian basis of economic and 
cultural existence. They feel like fish out of water.  
e) Kinship systems, marriages, social and cultural functions, their folk -songs, dances  and 
activities van ish with their displacement, even when they are resettled; it is individual -based 
resettlement, which totally ignores communal settlement.  
f) Loss of identity and loss of the intimate link between the people and the  environment is one of 
the biggest loss. The age -long indigenous knowledge,  which has been inherited and experienced 
by them about the flora, fauna, their  uses etc. gets lost.  
 85 
 Rehabilitation policy:  
There is a need for a comprehensive National Rehabilitation Policy. Different states are 
followin g different practices in this regard.  
 
CASE STUDY:  
 
In case of sardar sarovar project  Gujarat Government is formulating its policy through various 
government resolutions. It has decided that each landed outstee shall be entitled to allotment of 
irrigable land in the state which he chooses for his resettlement. The area of the land would be  
equal to that owned by his earlier and the minimum land given to an outstee would be 2 hectares. 
However, there are problems of landless outstees and those natives who were cultivating forest 
land. The cut -off date for identifying an adult son in a family  has been fixed. It is important since 
the adult son is to be treated as a separate family. The people of 20 submerged villages in Gujrat 
hane been resettled at different locations leading to disintegration of joint families.  
 
3.4.4 CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
Climate  is the average weather of an area. It is the general weather conditions, seasonal 
variations and extremes of weather in region. Such conditions which average over a long period 
at least 30 years is called climate.  
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate C hange (IPCC) in 1990 and 1992published best 
available evidence about past climate change, the green house effect and recent changes in global 
temperature. It is observed that earth’s temperature has changed considerably during the 
geological times. It has experienced several glacial and interglacial periods.  
However, during the past10000 years of the current interglacial period, the mean average 
temperature has fluctuated by 0.51˚ c over 100 to 200 year period. We have relatively stable 
climate for thousan ds of years due to which we have practiced agriculture and increased 
population.  
Even small changes in climatic conditions may disturb agriculture that would lead to migration 
of animals including humans.  
Anthropogenic activities are upsetting the delica te balance that has been established between 
various components of the environment.  
Green house gases are increasing in atmosphere resulting in increase in the average global 
temperature.  
This may upset the hydrological cycle; result in floods and droughts in different regions of the 
world, cause sea level rise, changes in agricultural productivity, famines and death of humans as 
well as livestock  
3.4.5 GLOBAL WARMING  
Introduction:  
Before the Industrial Revolution, human activities released very few  gases into the atmosphere 
and all climate changes happened naturally. After the Industrial Revolution, through fossil fuel 
combustion, changing agricultural practices and deforestation, the natural composition of gases 
in the atmosphere is getting affecte d and climate and environment began to alter significantly.  
Over the last 100 years, it was found out that the earth is getting warmer and warmer, unlike 
previous 8000 years when temperatures have been relatively constant. The present temperature is 
0.3 - 0.6 o
C warmer than it was 100 years ago.  86 
 The greenhouse effect  is a naturally occurring process that aids in heating the Earth's surface 
and atmosphere. It results from the fact that certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxi de, 
water vapor , and methane , are able to change the energy balance of the planet by absorbing 
long wave  radiation  emitted from the Earth's surface. Without the greenhouse effect life on this 
planet would probably not exist as the average temperature of the Earth would be a chilly -18° 
Celsius, rather than the present 15° Celsius.  
Some greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, while others result from human 
activities. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, and ozone (refer Figure 9.4). Certain human activities, however , add to the levels 
of most of these naturally occurring gases.  
Carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere when solid waste, fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and 
coal), and wood and wood products are burned.  
Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane 
emissions also result from the decomposition of organic wastes in municipal solid waste 
landfills, and the raising of livestock. Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial 
activities, as wel l as during combustion of solid waste and fossil fuels.  
Very powerful greenhouse gases that are not naturally occurring include hydro fluorocarbons  
(HFCs), per fluorocarbons  (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), which are generated in a 
variety of indust rial processes.  
Often, estimates of greenhouse gas emissions are presented in units of millions of metric tons of 
carbon equivalents (MMTCE), which weights each gas by its Global Warming Potential or GWP 
value.  
As energy from the Sun passes through the at mosphere a number of things take place. A portion 
of the energy (26% globally) is reflected  or scattered  back to space by clouds and other 
atmospheric particles. About 19% of the energy available is absorbed by clouds, gases (like 
ozone ), an d particles in the atmosphere. Of the remaining 55% of the solar energy passing 
through the Earth's atmosphere, 4% is reflected from the surface back to space. On average, 
about 51% of the Sun's radiation reaches the surface. This energy is then used in a number of 
processes, including the heating of the ground surface; the melting of ice and snow and the 
evaporation of water; and plant photosynthesis .  
 
 
87 
 The heating of the ground by sunlight causes the Earth's surface  to become a radiator of energy  
in the long wave band (sometimes called infrared radiation ). This emissi on of energy is 
generally directed to space . However, only a small portion of this energy actually makes it back 
to space. The majority of the outgoing infrared radiation is absorbed by the greenhouse gases  
Absorption of long wave radiation by the atmosphere causes additional heat energy to be added 
to the Earth's atmospheric system. The now warmer atmospheric greenhouse gas molecules 
begin radiating long wave energy in all directions. Over 90% of this emission of long wave 
energy is directed back to the Earth's surface where it once again is absorbed by the surface. The 
heating of the ground by the long wave radiation causes the ground surface to once again radiate, 
repeating the cycle described above, again and again, until no more long wave is available for 
absorption.  
A number of gases are involved in the human caused enhancement of the greenhouse effect 
.These gases include: carbon dioxide  (CO 2); methane  (CH 4); nitrous oxide  (N2O); 
chlorofluorocarbons  (CFxClx); and tropospheric ozone  (O3). Of these gases, the single most 
important gas is carbon dioxide  which accounts for about 55% of the change in the intensity of 
the Earth's greenhouse effect. The contributions of the other gases are 25% for 
chlorofluorocarbons , 15% for methane , and 5% for nitrous oxide . Ozone's  contribution to the 
enhancement  of green house effect is still  yet to be quantified .Aver age concentrations of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide  in the year 2005 were about 380 parts per million .Prior to 1700, 
levels of carbon  dioxide were about 280 parts per million. This increase in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere is primarily due to the activities of humans. Beginning in 1700, societal change s 
brought about by the Industrial Revolution  increased the amount of carbon dioxide entering the 
atmosphere. The major sources of this gas include fossil fuel co mbustion for industry, 
transportation, space heating, electricity generation and cooking; and vegetation changes in 
natural prairie, woodland, and forested ecosystems. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
account for about 65% of the extra carbon dioxide now found in our atmosphere. The remaining 
35% is derived from deforestation and the conversion of prairie, woodland, and forested 
ecosystems primarily into agricultural systems.  
Natural ecosystems can hold 20 to 100 times more carbon dioxide per unit ar ea than agricultural 
systems. Artificially created chlorofluorocarbons  are the strongest greenhouse gas per 
molecule. However, low concentrations in the atmosphere reduce their overall importance in the 
enhancement  of the greenhouse effect.  
Current measurements in the atmosphere indicate that the concentration of these chemicals may 
soon begin declining because of reduced emissions. Reports of the development of ozo ne holes 
over the North and South Poles and a general decline in global stratospheric ozone levels over 
the last two decades has ca used many nations to cut back  on their production  and use of these  
chemicals.  
Since 1750, methane  concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by more than 150%. The 
primary sources for the additional methane added to the atmosphere (in order of importance) are 
rice cultivation, domestic grazing animals, termites, landfills, coal mining, and oil and gas 
extraction. Anaerobic conditions associated with rice paddy flooding results in the formation of 
methane gas. However, an accurate estimate of how much methane is b eing produced from rice 
paddies has been difficult to obtain. More than 60% of all rice paddies are found in India and 88 
 China where scientific data concerning emission rates are unavailable. Nevertheless, scientists 
believe that the contribution of rice pad dies is large because this form of crop production has 
more than doubled since 1950. Grazing animals release methane to the environment as a result of 
herbaceous digestion. Some researchers believe the addition of methane from this source has 
more than qua drupled over the last century. Termites also release methane through similar 
processes. Land -use change in the tropics, due to deforestation, ranching, and farming, may be 
causing termite numbers to expand. If this assumption is correct, the contribution f rom these 
insects may be important. Methane is also released from landfills, coal mines, and gas and oil 
drilling. Landfills produce methane as organic wastes decompose over time. Coal, oil, and 
natural gas deposits release methane to the atmosphere when t hese deposits are excavated or 
drilled.  
 
The average concentration of nitrous oxide  in the atmosphere is now increasing at a rate of 0.2 
to 0.3% per year. Sources for t his increase include land -use conversion; fossil fuel combustion; 
biomass burning; and soil fertilization. Most of the nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere each 
year comes from deforestation and the conversion of forest, savanna and grassland ecosystems 
into agricultural fields and rangeland. Both of these processes reduce the amount of nitrogen 
stored in living vegetation and soil through the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is 
also released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and biomass are burned. However, the 
combined contribution of these sources to the increase of this gas in the atmosphere is thought to 
be minor. The use of nitrate and ammonium fertilizers to enhance plant growth is another source 
of nitrous oxide. Accurate measureme nts of how much nitrous oxide is being released from 
fertilization have been difficult to obtain. Estimates suggest that the contribution from this source 
may represent from 50% to 0.2% of nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere annually.  
 
Ozone's  role in the enhancement of the greenhouse effect has been difficult to determine 
scientifically. Accurate measurements of past long -term (more than 25 years in the past) levels of 
this g as in the atmosphere are currently unavailable. Concentrations of ozone gas are found in 
two different regions of the Earth's atmosphere. The majority of the ozone (about 97%) found in 
the atmosphere is localized in the stratosphere  at an altitude of 15 to 55 kilometers above the 
Earth's surface. In recent years, the concentration of the stratosp heric ozone  has been 
decreasing because of the buildup of chlorofluorocarbons  in the atmosphere. Since the late 
1970s, scientists have discovered that total column ozone  amounts over Antarctica in the 
springtime have decreased by as much as 70%. Satellite measurements have indicated that the 
zone from 65° North to 65° South l atitude has had a 3% decrease in stratospheric ozone since 
1978. Ozone is also highly concentrated at the Earth's surface. Most of this ozone is created as an 
artificial by product of photochemical smog . 
Global Warming (Climate Change) Implications  
Rise in global temperature  
Observations show that global temperatures have risen by about 0.6 °C over the 20th century. 
There is strong evidence now that most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is caused 
by human activities. Climate models predict that the global tempera ture will rise by about 6 °C 
by the year 2100.  
 
 
 
 
 89 
 Rise in sea level  
 
In general, the faster the climate change, the greater will be the risk of damage. The mean sea 
level is expected to rise 9 - 88 cm by the year 2100, causing flooding of low lying area s and 
other damages.  
 
Food shortages and hunger  
Water resources will be affected as precipitation and evaporation patterns change around the 
world. This will affect agricultural output. Food security is likely to be threatened and some 
regions are likely  to experience food shortages and hunger.  
 
3.4.6 ACID RAIN  
 
Oxides of sulfur and nitrogen originating from industrial operations and fossil fuel combustion 
are the major sources of acid forming gases. Acid forming gases are oxidized over several days 
by which time they travel several thousand kilometers. In the atmosphere these gases are 
ultimately converted into sulfuric and nitric acids. Hydrogen chloride emission forms 
hydrochloric acid. These acids cause acidic rain. Acid rain is only one component of  acidic 
deposition. Acidic decomposition is the total wet acidic deposition (acid rain) and dry deposition. 
Rain water is turned acidic when its pH falls below 5.6. In fact clean or natural rain water has a 
pH of 5.6 at 20˚ c because of formation of carbon ic acid due to dissolution of CO2 in water. In 
absence of rain, dry deposition of acid may occur. Acid forming gases like oxides of sulphur and 
nitrogen and acid aerosols get deposited on the surface of  water bodies, vegetation, soil and other 
materials. O n moist surfaces or in liquids these acid forming gases can dissolve an form acids 
similar to that formed in acid rain.  
 
Effects of acid rain:  
 
Acid rain causes a number of harmful effects below pH 5.1. The effects are visible in the aquatic 
even at pH les s than 5.5.  
1. It causes deterioration of buildings especially made of marble e.g. monuments like Taj Mahal. 
Crystals of calcium and magnesium sulphate are formed as a result of corrosion caused by acid 
rain. 
2. It damages stone statues. Priceless stone st atues in Greece and Italy have been partially 
dissolved by acid rain.  
3. It damages metals and car finishes.  
4. Aquatic life especially fish are badly affected by lake acidification  
5. Aquatic animals suffer from toxicity of metals such as aluminium, mercu ry, manganese, zinc 
and lead which leak from the surrounding rocks due to acid rain.  
6. It results in reproductive failure, and killing of fish.  
7. Many lakes of Sweden, Norway, and Canada  have become fishless due to acid rain.  
8. It damages foliage and we akens trees  
9. It makes trees more susceptible to stresses like cold temperature, drought, etc . Many insects 
and fungi are more tolerant to acidic conditions and hence they can attack the susceptible trees 
and cause diseases.  
 
 90 
 Control measures:  
 
1. Emiss ion of SO 2 and NO 2 from industries and power plants should be  
     reduced by using pollution control equipments.  
2. Liming of lakes and soils should be done to correct the adverse effects of acid  
     rain. 
3. A coating of protective layer of inert polymer should be given in the interior of  water pipes                   
    for drinking water  
 
3.4.7 OZONE LAYER DEPLETION  
 
As early as 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius had predicted that human activities 
would interfere with the way the sun interacts with the earth, resulting in global warming and 
climate change. His prediction has become true and climate change is  now disrupting global 
environmental stability. The last few decades have seen many treaties, conventions, and 
protocols for the cause of global environmental protection.  
Few examples of environmental issues of global significance are:  
• Ozone layer depl etion  
• Global warming  
 
One of the most important characteristics of this environmental degradation is that it affects all 
mankind on a global scale without regard to any particular country, region, or race. The whole 
world is a stakeholder and this rais es issues on who should do what to combat environmental 
degradation.  
 
Earth’s atmosphere is divided into three regions, namely troposphere, stratosphere and 
mesosphere. The stratosphere extends from 10 to 50 kms from the Earth’s surface. This region is 
concentrated with slightly pungent smelling, light bluish ozone gas. The ozone gas is made up of 
molecules each containing three atoms of oxygen; its chemical formula is O3.  
The ozone layer, in the stratosphere acts as an efficient filter for harmful solar Ultraviolet B 
(UV-B) rays Ozone is produced and destroyed naturally in the atmosphere and until recently, this 
resulted in a well -balanced equilibrium .  
   
 
Ozone is formed when oxygen molecules absorb ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths less than 
240 nanometres and is destroyed when it absorbs ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths greater 
than 290 nanometres. In recent years, scientists have measured a seasonal thinning of the ozone 
layer primarily at the South Pole. This phenomenon is being called th e ozone hole.  
 
91 
 Ozone Depletion Process  
Ozone is highly reactive and easily broken down by man -made chlorine and bromine 
compounds. These compounds are found to be most responsible for most of ozone layer 
depletion.  
The ozone depletion process begins when CFCs (used in refrigerator and air cond itioners) and 
other ozone -depleting substances (ODS) are emitted into the atmosphere. Winds efficiently mix 
and evenly distribute the ODS in the troposphere. These ODS compounds do not dissolve in rain, 
are extremely stable, and have a long life span. Afte r several years, they reach the stratosphere 
by diffusion.  
Strong UV light breaks apart the ODS molecules. CFCs, HCFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl 
chloroform release chlorine atoms, and halons and methyl bromide release bromine atoms. It is 
the chlorine  and bromine atom that actually destroys ozone, not the intact ODS molecule. It is 
estimated that one chlorine atom can destroy from 10,000 to 100,000 ozone molecules before it 
is finally removed from the stratosphere.  
Chemistry of Ozone Depletion  
When ul traviolet light waves (UV) strike CFC* (CFCl3) molecules in the upper atmosphere, a 
carbon -chlorine bond breaks, producing a chlorine (Cl) atom. The chlorine atom then reacts with 
an ozone (O3) molecule breaking it apart and so destroying the ozone. This forms an ordinary 
oxygen molecule (O2) and a chlorine monoxide (ClO) molecule. Then a free oxygen** atom 
breaks up the chlorine monoxide. The chlorine is free to repeat the process of destroying more 
ozone molecules. A single CFC molecule can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules.  
* CFC - chlorofluorocarbon: it contains chlorine, fluorine and carbon atoms. ** UV radiation 
breaks oxygen molecules (O2) into single oxygen atoms.  
 
Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion  
1) Effects on Human and Animal Health: Increas ed penetration of solar UV -B radiation is 
likely to have high impact on human health with potential risks of eye diseases, skin cancer and 
infectious diseases.  
2) Effects on Terrestrial Plants: In forests and grasslands, increased radiation is likely to 
change species composition thus altering the bio -diversity in different ecosystems. It could also 
may affect  the plant community.  
3) Effects on Aquatic Ecosystems: High levels of radiation exposure in tropics and subtropics 
may affect the distribution of Phytoplankton’s , which form the foundation of aquatic food webs. 
It can also cause damage to early development stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other 
animals, the most severe effects being decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval 
devel opment.  92 
 4)Effects on Bio -geo-chemical Cycles: Increased solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and 
aquatic bio -geo-chemical cycles thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and 
important trace gases, e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxid e (CO), carbonyl sulfide 
(COS), etc. These changes would contribute to biosphere -atmosphere feedbacks responsible for 
the atmosphere build -up of these greenhouse gases.  
5) Effects  on Air Quality: Reduction of stratospheric ozone and increased penetration of UV -B 
radiation result in higher photo dissociation rates of key trace gases that control the chemical 
reactivity of the troposphere. This can increase both production and destruction of ozone and 
related oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, which are kno wn to have adverse effects on human 
health, terrestrial plants and outdoor materials.  
The ozone layer, therefore, is highly beneficial to plant and animal life on earth filtering out the 
dangerous part of sun’s radiation and allowing only the beneficial p art to reach earth. Any 
disturbance or depletion of this layer would result in an increase of harmful radiation reaching 
the earth’s surface leading to dangerous consequences . 
 
3.4.8 NUCLEAR HOLOCOST AND NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS  
Nuclear holocaust  refers to a possible nearly complete annihilation of human civilization  by 
nuclear warfare . Under  such a scenario, all or most of the Earth is made uninhabitable by nuclear 
weapons  in future worl d wars . 
Nuclear physicists and others have speculated that nuclear holocaust could result in an end to 
human life, or at least to modern civilization on Earth due to the immediate effects of nuclear 
fallout , the loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses , or nuclear winter  and 
resulting extinctions . Since 1947, the Doomsday Clock  of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  
visualizes how far the world is from a nuclear holocaust.  
The threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the popular perception of nuclear 
weapons . It features in the security conc ept of mutually assured destruction (MAD)  and is a 
common scenario in survival ism. Nuclear holocaust is a common feature in literature , especially 
in speculative genres  such as science fiction , dystopian  and post-apocalyptic fiction . 
The English word "holocaust", derived from the Greek  term "holokaustos" meaning "completely 
burnt", is commonly defined as "a great destruction resulting in the extensive loss of life, 
especially by fire."  
 
Case study: Chernobyl reactor  
 
A mishandled reactor safety test led to an uncontrolled power excursion, causing a severe steam 
explosion, meltdown and release of radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
located approximately 100 kilometers north -northwest of Kiev. Approximately fifty fatalities 
resulted from the  accident and the immediate aftermath most of these being cleanup personnel. 
An additional nine fatal cases of thyroid cancer in children in the Chernobyl area have been 
attributed to the accident. The explosion and combustion of the graphite reactor core spread 93 
 radioactive material over much of Europe. 100,000 people were evacuated from the areas 
immediately surrounding Chernobyl in addition to 300,000 from the areas of heavy fallout in 
Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. An "Exclusion Zone" was created surroundi ng the site 
encompassing approximately 1,000 mi² (3,000 km²) and deemed off -limits for human habitation 
for an indefinite period. Several studies by governments, UN agencies and environmental groups 
have estimated the consequences and eventual number of ca sualties. Their findings are subject to 
controversy.  
Nuclear weapons causes holocaust:  
If all the nuclear weapons in the world were used, then all of humanity would most like be 
destroyed. This is for several reasons. Firstly, most major cities would be de stroyed by incoming 
warheads. However, this would leave some areas untouched. Thes e areas would most likely be 
reached by radioactive fall -out blown by the wind. These would be the immediate repurcussions.  
Later, the world would go into what is called "N uclear Winter". Global temperatures would drop 
significantly, as well as the amount of sunlight received by the earth. This is very similar to what 
is believed happened to the dinosaurs. It is believed that a large asteroid collided with the earth, 
and sti rred up a lot of dust into the atmosphere. This blotted out the sun, and plants died. With 
very few plants to eat, the dinosaurs (and many other animals) went extinct. Nuclear winter 
would be a lot like this. The only difference is that there the dust woul d be raised up by 
impacting nuclear warheads and their explosions. Additionally, the dust would be radioactive. 
The combination of radioactivity, lack of food, and lowering temperatures cause a Nuclear 
Holocaust, with the chances of humans surviving it ver y low.

GREEN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  
 
4.1. CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM  
 
History and Objectives of the Mechanism:  
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an economic instrument for inducing initiatives to 
meet the challenges faced by the impending threat of climate change. It is a mechanism for 
promoting technology transfer and investment from developed countries to the developing 
countries for projects to reduce the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). The mechanism 
allows the government s or private parties of developed countries to make investment for 
emission reduction projects in developing countries and, in turn, get the benefit in terms of 
“Certified Emission Reduction (CER)” which could be credited against their national emission 
reduction targets.  
 
The concept of CDM owes its origin to the Kyoto Protocol (1997) under the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mooted at the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (Earth Summit) in 1992. The Convention on Climate Change and 
the follow -up initiatives were prompted by the increasing evidence of global warming triggered 
by anthropogenic emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) which include Carbon Dioxide, 
Nitrous Oxide, Methane, Halogenated Hydrocarbon and Tropos pheric Ozone. According to an 
assessment, doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere or an equivalent 
increase of a mixture of greenhouse gases can cause 1.5 to 4.5oC rise in global temperature with 
associated impacts such as sea level rise , 
Floods  and droughts.  
Purpose  
The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the "non -
Annex I" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The 
CDM is one of the Protocol's "projec t-based" mechanisms  in that the CDM is designed to 
promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction 
"production". These reductions are "produced" and then subtracted against a hypothetical 
"baseline" of emission s. The emissions baseline are the emissions that are predicted to occur in 
the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are "credited" against this baseline, in 
the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts. The CD M is 
one of the "flexibility mechanisms" that is defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility 
mechanisms are designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction 
commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007).The flexibil ity mechanisms 
were introduced to the Kyoto Protocol by the US government.  
 
For participation in CDM, all countries are required to meet the following prerequisites:  
􀂾 Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol;  
􀂾 Establishment of a National CDM Authority; and  95 
 􀂾 Willingness for voluntary participation in CDM.  
 
In addition to the aforesaid pre -requisites, the developed countries should also comply  
with the following requirements as stipulated in the Protocol:  
􀂾 National System for the estimation of GHG emissions;  
􀂾 National registry and annual inventory;  
􀂾 Accounting system for sale and purchase of emission reductions; and  
􀂾 Establishment of assigned amount as per emission limitation and reduction  
Commitment  to reduce their overall GHG emission  by at least 5 per cent below 1990    
levels in the first commitment period of 2008 -2012.  
 
The eligibility criteria for the CDM projects include the following:  
􀂾 The projects must be approved by all parties involved;  
􀂾 The projects should promote sustain able development in host countries;  
􀂾 The projects should result in real, measurable and long term benefits towards  
    climate change mitigation; and  
􀂾 The emission reduction should be additional to what would have otherwise

The institutional structure created for implementation of CDM includes three new  
entities:

􀂾 Designated National Authority; and  
􀂾 Designated Operational Entity.

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Project Cycle  
The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol defines a series of steps necessary to 
develop certified emissions reductions (CERs):  
1. Project Design  96 
 2. Project Validation  
3. Host Country Approval  
4. Registration with the CDM Executive Board  
5. Implementation and Monitoring  
6. Verification/Certification and Issuance of CERs  
7. Sale of CERs  
 
1.Project Design  
The first step starts with a determination of whether the project concept wo uld qualify as a CDM 
project, including screening against project criteria, estimating the magnitude of emissions 
reductions, and preparing a Project Design Document (PDD) to meet certain specifications. The 
PDD must address the following key issues:  
• Establishing the "baseline" for the project, which represents the anthropogenic emissions 
that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity?  The current flaring of 
gas may be an important consideration in establishing this baseline.  
• Demonstrating "additionality," which in essence is a demonstration that the proposed 
project is not "business as usual." While this criterion has proved to be controversial on 
some projects, a series of guidelines is now available for making the additional ity 
demonstration. and there is precedent for landfill gas recovery projects of the type 
envisioned.  
• A monitoring methodology that effectively addresses gas flow and composition.  
It is also critical to provide a basis for legal ownership of the project act ivity, i.e. the rights to the 
gas generated at landfill or wastewater treatment plant.  
2.Project Validation  
Validation is the process by which the PDD is independently evaluated by a "designated 
operation entity" (DOE) against the requirements of the CDM. The DOE must be a third party, 
separate and apart from the project developer and preparer of the PDD. Information submitted to 
the DOE should include comments by the local stakeholders and a summary of how due account 
was taken of any such comments, as wel l as an analysis of any environmental impact of the 
project's activity.  
97 
 Based on its review, the DOE issues a validation report and opinion as to the adequacy of the 
PDD. The project developer/PDD consultant must respond to queries and comments to the 
satisfaction of the DOE for the final validation report to be issued.  
3.Host Country Approval  
Upon validation of the proposed project by the DOE, the following documentation must be 
submitted to the designated national authority (DNA) for host country approv al:  
1. The validation report.  
2. The PDD, including a description of how the project will contribute to sustainable 
development.  
3. If required by local law, an approved environmental impact assessment.  
4. A written commitment to deliver an annual report on the results of monitoring, 
certification, and issuance of CERs.  
Once the DNA requirements have been satisfied, a Letter of Approval is issued for the project.  
4.RegistrationwiththeCDMExecutive Board  
Following the issuance of the Letter of Approval, a request for registration is submitted to the 
CDM Executive Board in the form of the validation report, including the PDD, the written 
approval of the DNA and an explanation of how this takes into account any comments received. 
The CDM Executive Board reviews the proposal and may invite public comment or ask for 
additional information/details before rejecting or accepting the proposal, which becomes a public 
document once submitted to the CDM Executive Board. R egistration is a formal acceptance by 
the CDM Executive Board of a validated project as a CDM project activity and is the official 
recognition of the project feasibility to generate CER.  
5.Implementationand Monitoring  
Once the project has been validated, d etailed engineering activities can be undertaken in parallel 
with the CDM approval process. Typically, construction would not occur until after CDM 
Executive Board approval. Monitoring of emissions reductions, as specified in the PDD 
monitoring plan, would  then be implemented. In order to calculate the emissions reductions, the 
emissions of the project activity have to be subtracted from the reference scenario or Baseline 
outlined in the PDD.  
6. Verification /Certification  and issuance  of CERs  
Verification is required by a DOE, separate and apart from the preparer of the PDD and the DOE 
responsible for project validation, in order to demonstrate that actual emissions reductions are 
consistent with the PDD. A certification report is required on an annual basi s to quantify the 
actual emissions reductions achieved during that period. The second DOE conducts on -site 
inspections, reviews monitoring results, and provides a verification report to the CDM Executive 
Board.  The certification constitutes a request to t he CDM Executive Board for issuance of CERs 
equal to the verified amount of reductions from the project. This issuance should be considered 
final 15 days after the day of receipt of the request for issuance, unless issues are raised by the 
CDM Executive Bo ard or other parties involved. The requisite amount of CERs is then deposited 
in the registry account of the project developer.  
7. Sale  of CERs  
The process of negotiating the sale of the CERs can usually start as the PDD is being finalized. A 
Term Sheet s pelling out the terms of the agreement is initially prepared and later used for 98 
 drafting the so -called Emissions Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). These agreements 
define the amount of CERs to be transferred, the purchase price, the time period of deli very, and 
other relevant conditions. ENVIRON is experienced in developing these agreements and 
working with the buyers in the emissions reductions marketplace, e.g., World Bank’s Prototype 
Carbon Fund, tenders by national governments, brokers, and private sector buyer

4.2 CARB ON FOOTPRINT  
INTRODUCTION:  
‘Carbon footprint’ measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by 
a person, organization, event or product.  
The footprint considers all six of the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide (CO2), 
Methane (CH4), Nitrous  oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) 
and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).  
A carbon footprint is measured in tones of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). The carbon 
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) allows the different greenhouse gases to be compared on a like -for-
like basis relative to one unit of CO2. CO2e is calculated by multiplying the emissions of each of 
the six greenhouse gases by its 100 year global warming potential (GWP).  
 
 99 
 The main types of carbon footprint for organizations are :  
A) ORGANISATIONAL CARBON FOOTPRINT  
Emissions from all the activities across the organization, including buildings ’ energy use, 
industrial processes and company vehicles.  
An organizational or business carbon footprint measures the direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions arising from all of an organization’s activities.  A good place to get an estimation 
of your b usiness carbon footprint is our carbon footprint indicator . Read more about 
organizational carbon footprints below.  
• Types of emissions  
• Why calculate  
• How to calculate - organizational carbon footprints  
• How we can help  
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol* standard is commonly used to categorize an organization’s 
emissions into 3 groups or ‘scopes’:  
• Scope 1 - Direct emissions  
Direct emissions resulting from activities within the organization’s control. Includes on -
site fuel combustion, manufacturing and process emissions, refrigerant losses and 
company vehicles.  
• Scope 2 - Indirect emissions: electricity and heat  
Indirect emissions from electricity, heat or steam purchased and used  by the organization.  
• Scope 3 - Indirect emissions: other  
Any other indirect emissions from sources not directly controlled by the organization. 
Examples include: employee business travel, outsourced transportation, waste disposal, 
water usage and employee  commuting.  
Under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an organization must include scope 1 and 2 emissions 
within its carbon footprint. There is broad discretion about which scope 3 emissions should be 
included in a business carbon footprint - for example; organ izations often include waste disposed 
to landfill and employee business travel from scope 3.  
If you have your energy usage details, use our carbon footprint calculator  to calculate your 
organizational carbon footprint.  
* The Greenh ouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, revised 
edition. World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute.  
The 2 main reasons for calculating an organizational carbon footprint are that it will help  you to:  
• Manage and reduce emissions  
Reducing your business carbon footprint often results in cost savings. Analyzing your 
organization’s carbon footprint will help you to identify and prioritize areas for potential 
reduction.  100 
 • Reporting  
More and more orga nizations want to be able to demonstrate their carbon footprint for 
reasons of:  
o Mandatory reporting requirements  
Climate change legislation such as the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme (CRC)  or EU Emissions Trading Scheme  require such 
reporting, for examp le.  
o Corporate social responsibility (CSR)  
Showing that you are behaving in a responsible and ethical way is becoming ever 
more important  
o Responding to requests  
Partners, customers and investors are increasingly interested in carbon emissions 
data. There are also carbon reporting initiatives such as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project .  
Steps:  
The basic 6 steps required to calculate a carbon footprint for an organization are as follows:  
1. Establishment of th e assessment boundaries:  
• Organizational  
• Operational  
• Greenhouse gases  
2. Collection of data.  
3. Calculation of emissions using appropriate emissions factors  
4.Convert usage into CO2 equivalent  
5.Verifying the results (optional)  
6.Reporting the carbon footprint  
 
1. Method definition  
You need to have a consistent method to get accurate results – especially if you are going to rely 
on lots of different people to collect and interpret data.  
Good sources of standards include:  
• Greenhouse Gas Protocol  
Free set of commonly used standards  
• International Organization for Standardization, ISO 14064  
Builds on many of the concepts introduced by the GHG Prot ocol  
2. Establishment of the assessment boundaries:  
You will need to define:  
• Organizational boundaries  
What parts of the organization are included? This can be complex for large organizations 
with many subsidiaries, joint ventures or leased assets.  
• Oper ational boundaries  
All scope 1  and scope 2  emissions should be included, but the organization can choose 
which scope 3  emissions to include.  101 
 When choosing a boundary try to take account of how your organization works, other reporting 
periods, legislative  requirements, and the practicalities of data collection.  
3. Collate data  
It is important to collect data as thoroughly and accurately as possible. The main sources of data 
are usually:  
• Gas and electricity  – meter readings or bills (kWh)  
• Other fuels  – usage in liters, kWh, MJ, liters  
• Transport – usage by fuel type (if this is  not possible estimate it based on the mileage of 
the vehicles and fuel economy assumptions)  
4.ConvertusageintoCO2 equivalent  
The carbon footprint is measured in tones CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). This is calculated by 
converting the data you have collected. Yo u should always use conversions from credible 
sources, see our conversion factor tables.  It is important that you identify any data gaps and list 
the assumptions you have made in calculating the footprint.  
5.Verifyingtheresults (optional)  
To add credibility, it makes sense for a third party to verify your carbon footprint. The Carbon 
Trust Standard  is one such company that can do this – as well as helping you to measure, reduce, 
and communicate your carbon footprint.  
6.Reportingthecarbon footprint  
Make sure you carbon footprint is presented clearly and honestly. This means providin g 
complete information about each of the steps above, including methods, footprint boundaries,  
data quality and assumptions. Also - try to keep a consistent approach over different years, 
explaining any changes in reporting or business structure that might  impact the footprint.  
 
B) PRODUCT CARBON FOOTPRINT  
Emissions over the whole life of a product or service, from the extraction of raw materials and 
manufacturing right through to its use and final reuse, recycling or disposal.  
A product carbon footprint measures the greenhouse gas emissions at each stage of the product’s 
life. 
A product carbon footprint measures the gre enhouse gas emissions at each stage of the product’s 
life. This includes:  
• Extraction, production and transportation of raw materials  
• Manufacture or service provision  
• Distribution  
• End-use  
• Disposal/recycling  102 
 At each stage greenhouse gas emissions can result from such sources as: energy use, 
transportation fuel refrigerant losses from air conditioning units and waste. In the case of a 
“service product” the life -cycle stages are defined across the duration of th e service.  
Measuring a product’s carbon footprint offers a number of benefits, including:  
• Attracting customers  
Customers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the goods 
and services they use.  Working with  the Carbon  Trust Foot printing Company or 
demonstrating a lower footprint than competitor products can deliver competitive 
advantage.  
• Brand identity  
Reporting product carbon footprints shows that an organization takes its social 
respons ibility seriously.  
• Leadership  
Reporting your products’ carbon footprints will support your corporate responsibility 
programme and enhance your reputation.  
• Cost savings  
Identifying areas where greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced often results in cost 
savings - in terms of transport energy, waste and packaging for example.  
• Emissions savings  
Looking at the whole supply chain could help you identify savings.  
The basic steps required to calculate a carbon footprint for a product are as follows:  
1. Analyze the materials and supply chain processes.  
2. Build a supply chain map for the product.  
3. Define the assessment boundaries (including the selection of greenhouse gases             
    and the emissions sources which will be included).  
4. Data colle ction  
5. Calculation of emissions using appropriate emissions factors.  
1. The primary footprint  is a measure of our direct emissions of CO 2 from the burning of fossil 
fuels including domestic energy consumption and transportation (e.g. car and plane). We h ave 
direct control of these.  
2. The secondary footprint  is a measure of the indirect CO 2 emissions from the whole lifecycle 
of products we use - those associated with their manufacture and eventual breakdown. To put it 
very simply – the more we buy the mor e emissions will be caused on our behalf.  
Product Carbon Footprints are commonly expressed either as ‘cradle to gate’ footprints, or 
‘cradle  to grave’ depending on the life -cycle stages included.

4.3 CARBON CREDIT  
INTRODUCTION  
Carbon credits are a tradable permit  scheme. It is a simple, non -compulsory  way to counteract 
the greenhouse gasses that  contribute to climate change and global warming. Carbon credits 
create a market for reducing greenhouse emissions by giving a monetary value to the cost of 
polluting the air. The Carbon Credit is this new currency and each carbon credit represents one 
tonne of carbon dioxide either removed from the atmos phere or saved from being emitted. 
Carbon credits are also called emission permit. Carbon credit is in the Environment and Pollution 
Control  subject. Carbon credits are certi ficates awarded to countries that are successful in 
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases . 
 
GENERATIONOFCARBONCREDITS  
 
Carbon credits are generated as the result of an additional carbon project . Carbon credits can be 
created in many ways but there are two broad types:  
1. Sequestration (capturing o r retaining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) such as 
afforestation  and reforestation activities.  
2. Carbon Dioxide Saving Projects such as use of renewable energies  
These credits need to be authentic, scientifically based and Verification is essential.  
Carbon credit trading is an innovative method of controlling emissions using the free market.  
 
NEEDFORCARBON CREDITS  
 
Over millions of years, our planet has managed to  regulate concentrations of greenhouse gases 
through sources (emitters) and sinks (reservoirs). Carbon (in the form of CO2 and methane) is 
emitted by volcanoes, by rotting vegetation, by burning of fossil fuels and other organic matter. 
But CO2 is absorbed , by trees, forests or by some natural phenomenon like photosy nthesis and 
also oceas to some  extent.  
 
  
 
104 
 TYPES OF CARBON CREDIT  
 
There are two main markets for carbon credits:  
A) Compliance Market credits  
B)  Verified Market credits (VERs)  
 
VALUE OF CARBON CREDITS  
 
Carbon credits create a market for reducing greenhouse gases emissions by giving a monetary 
value to the cost of polluting the air such as carbon emitted by burning of fossil fuels. This 
means that carbon becomes a cost of business and is s een like other inputs such as raw materials 
or labor.  
 
Carbon credits are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide.  
1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2.  
Each carbon credit represents one metric ton of C02 either removed from the atmosphere or 
saved from being emitted. The carbon credit market creates a monetary value for carbon credits 
and allows the credits to be traded.  
For each tonne of carbon dioxide that is saved or sequestered carbon credit producers may sell 
one carbon credit.  
 
4.4 CARBON SEQUESTRATION or CARBON CAPTURE AND STROAGE or 
SCRUBBING  OF CO 2 
Carbon sequestration  is the capture of carbon dioxide  (CO 2) and may refer specifically to:  
• "The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir."  
When carried out deliberately, this may also be referred to as carbon dioxide removal , 
which is a form of geoengineering . 
• The process of carbon capture and storage , where carbon dioxide is removed from flue 
gases , such as on power stations , before being stored in und erground reservoirs.  
• Natural biogeochemical cycling  of carbon  between the atmosphere  and reservoirs, such 
as by chemical weathering  of rocks.  
Carbon sequestration describes long -term storage  of carbon dioxide  or other forms of carbon  to 
either mitigate or defer global warming  and avoid dangerous climate change . It has been 
propose d as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases , which 
are released by burning fossil fuels . 
Carbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical or 
physical processes. Some anthropogenic sequestration techniques exploit these natural processes, 
while some use entirely artificial processes.  
Carbon dioxide may be captured as a pure by -product in processes related to petroleum refining  
or from flue gases from power generation .CO 2 sequestration includes the storage part of carbon 
capture and storage, which refers to large -scale, permanent artificial capture and sequestration of 105 
 industrially produced CO 2 using subsurface saline aquifers , reservoirs, ocean water , aging oil 
fields , or other carbon sinks . 
STEPS :  
A) Capturing or Scrubbing  
B) Transporation  
C) Sequestration or Storage  
 
A) CAPTURING or SCRUBBING OF CO 2: 
 
TECHNOLOGIES:  
Broadly, three different types of technologies for scrubbing of CO 2 exist:  
2. post-combustion,  
3. pre-combustion, and  
4. oxyfuel combustion  
5. Chemical looping  
1. Post-Combustion:  In post combustion capture , the CO 2 is removed after combustion of the 
fossil fuel  — this is the scheme that would be applied to fossil -fuel burning power plants. Here, 
carbon dioxide is captured from flue gases  at power stations  or other large point sources. The 
technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although not 
at the same scale as might be required in a commercial scale power station.  
 
2. Pre-Combustion  : The technology for pre-combustion  is widely applied in fertilizer, 
chemical, gaseous fuel (H 2, CH 4), and power production. In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially 
oxidized, for instance in a gasifier . The resulting syngas  (CO and H 2O) is shifted  into CO 2 and 
more H 2. The resulting CO 2 can be  captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H 2 can 
now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are 
several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon 
dioxide captur e. The CO 2 is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is 
expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power 
plants, or to existing plants where re -powering is an option. The capture before ex pansion, i.e. 
from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial CO 2 capture processes, at the same scale 
as will be required for utility power plants. 
 
3. Oxy-Fuel Combustion : In oxy-fuel combustion  the fuel is burned in oxygen inste ad of air. To 
limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled 
flue gas is re -circulated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of 
mainly carbon dioxide and water vapor, the latter of w hich is condensed through cooling. The 
result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site 
and stored. Power plant processes based on oxy fuel combustion are sometimes referred to as 
"zero emission" cycles, beca use the CO 2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas 
stream (as in the cases of pre - and post -combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A 
certain fraction of the CO 2 generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed 
water. To warrant the label "zero emission" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed  
of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of 
energy.  
 106 
 4.Chemical looping combustion  (ClC ): Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen 
carrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed  
combustor, producing solid metal  particles and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The 
water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide which can then be sequestered. The solid 
metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat  
and regenerating metal oxide particles that are re circulated to the fluidized bed combustor.  
 
5. Calcium looping : A variant of chemical looping is calcium looping , which uses the 
alternating carbonation and then calcinations of a calcium oxide  based carrier as a means of 
capturing CO 2. 
 
 
B) TRANSPORT:  
After capture, the CO 2 would have to be transported to suitable storage sites. This is done by 
pipeline, which is generally the cheapest form of transport. In 2008, there were approximately 
5,800  km of CO 2 pipelines in the United States, used to transport CO 2 to oil production fields 
where it is then injected into older fields to extract oil. The injection of CO 2 to produce oil is 
generally called Enhanced Oil Recovery  or EOR. 
 In addit ion, there are several pilot programs in various stages to test the long -term storage of 
CO 2 in non -oil producing geologic formations.  
A COA conveyor belt system or ship could also be utilized for transport. These methods are 
currently used for transporting CO 2 for other applications.  
 
C) SEQUESTRATION or STORAGE:  
Various forms have been conceived for permanent storage of CO 2. These forms include gaseous 
storage in various deep geological formations (including saline formations and exhausted gas 
fields), liquid storage in the ocean, and solid storage by reaction of CO 2 with metal oxides  to 
produce stable carbonates . 
 
 
107 
 i) GEOLOGICAL  STORAGE: Also known as geo-sequestration , this method involves 
injecting carbon dioxide, generally in supercritical  form, directly into underground geological 
formations. Oil fields , gas fields , saline formations, unmineable coal seams , and saline -filled 
basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites. Various physical (e.g., highly 
impermeable cap rock ) and geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent the CO 2 from 
escaping to the  surface.  
Enhanced oil recovery: CO 2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil 
recovery .  This option is attractive because the geology of hy drocarbon reservoirs is generally 
well understood and storage costs may be partly offset by the sale of additional oil that is 
recovered. Disadvantages of old oil fields are their geographic distribution and their limited 
capacity, as well as the fact that  subsequent burning of the additional oil so recovered will offset 
much or all of the reduction in CO 2 emissions.  
Unmineable coal seams can be used to store CO 2 because the CO 2 molecules attach to the 
surface of coal. The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. 
In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed methane , and the methane can 
be recovered ( enhanced coal bed methane recovery ). The sale of the methane can be used to 
offset a portion of the cost of the CO 2 storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would 
produce CO 2, which would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original CO 2. 
 
II) OCEAN  STORAGE:  
Another proposed form of carbon storage is in the oceans. Several conce pts have been proposed:  
• 'Dissolution' injects CO 2 by ship or pipeline into the ocean water column at depths of 
1000 – 3000 m, forming an upward -plume, and the CO 2 subsequently dissolves in 
seawater.  
• Through 'lake' deposits, by injecting CO 2 directly into the sea at depths greater than 3000 
m, where high -pressure liquefies CO 2, making it denser than water, and forms a 
downward -plume that may accumulate on the sea floor as a 'lake', and is expected to 
delay dissolution of CO 2 into the ocean an d atmosphere, possibly for millennia.  
• Use a chemical reaction to combine CO 2 with a carbonate mineral (such as limestone ) to 
form bicarbonate (s), for example: CO 2 + CaCO 3 + H 2O → Ca(HCO 3)2(aq). However, the 
aqueous bicarbonate solution must not be allowed to dry out, or else the reaction will 
reverse.  
• Store the CO 2 in solid clathrate hydrates  already existing on the ocean floor,[23][24] or 
growing more solid clathrate.  
The environmental effects of oceanic storage are generally negative, and poorly understood. 
Large concentrations of CO 2 could kill ocean organisms, but another problem is that dissolved 
CO 2 would eventually equilibrate with the atmosphere, so the storage would not be permanent.In 
addition, as part of the CO 2 reacts with the water to form carbonic acid , H2CO 3, the acidity of the 
ocean water increases.  
The bicarbonate approach would reduce the pH effects and enhance the retention of CO 2 in the 
ocean, but this would also increase the costs and other  environmental effects.  
 
III) MINERAL STORAGE:  
In this process, CO 2 is exothermically  reacted with available metal oxides, which in turn 
produces stable carbonates. This process occurs  naturally over many years and is responsible for 
a great amount of surface limestone . The reaction rate can be made faster, for example by 108 
 reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressur es, or by pre -treatment of the minerals, although 
this method can require additional energy.  
Carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring Mg and Ca containing minerals with CO 2 to 
form carbonates has many unique advantages. Most notable is the fac t that carbonates have a 
lower energy state than CO 2, which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable 
and occurs naturally (e.g., the weathering of rock over geologic time periods). Secondly, the raw 
materials such as magnesium based minera ls are abundant. Finally, the produced carbonates are 
unarguably stable and thus re -release of CO 2 into the atmosphere is not an issue. However, 
conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures. The 
significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and 
environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be 
implemented with acceptable economics  
 
4.5 POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE   
The polluter pays principle  (PPP) is a basic economic idea that firms or consumers should pay 
for the cost of the negative externality they create. The polluter pays principle usually refers to 
environmental costs, but it could be extended to any external cost.  
In a purely free market, you would only face your private costs. However, for goods with 
negative externalities, there are additional external costs, e.g. damage to the environment . This 
means the social cost of some goods are greater than the private cost.  
The pollut er pays principle is simply the idea that we should pay the total social cost including 
the environmental costs. This requires some authority or government agency to calculate our 
external costs and make sure that we pay the full social cost. A simple exam ple, is a tax on 
petrol. When consuming petrol, we create pollution. The tax means the price we pay more 
closely reflects the social cost.  
The polluter pays principle is a way of ‘ internalizing  the externality’. It makes the firm / 
consumer pay the total s ocial cost, rather than just the private cost. (Social cost = private cost+ 
external cost)  
The polluter pays principle is an important basis of international law. In 1972, the OECD 
(Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development) wrote Guiding Princ iples 
concerning International Economic Aspects of Environmental Policies , stating:  
“ The polluter should bear the expenses of carrying out the above -mentioned measures decided 
by public authorities to ensure that the environment is in an acceptable state. ” 
The polluter pays principle was incorporated into the 1992 Rio summit  the declaration stated:  
 “National authorities should endeavor to promote the internalization of env ironmental costs and 
the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in 
principle, bear the cost of pollution , with due regard to the public interest and without 
distorting international trade and investment.”  109 
 Difficulties of implementing polluter pays principle  
• It can be difficult to measure how much pollution is produced, e.g. firms may try to hide 
the extent of their pollution.  
• It can be difficult to impose regulations or tax on firms from other countries. For 
example, when we contribute to global warming, the problem effects everyone around the 
world, but it can be difficult to create international agreements to impose penalties on 
those polluting.  
• Pollution havens. These are countries which have  weaker environmental legislation and 
firms can escape taxes and regulations on pollution by shifting production to those 
countries.  
• Some costs are unexpected and occur after the event. e.g. in building nuclear power plant.  
• Administration costs of collecting information and implementing tax. For example, a few 
drunks late at night may make a lot of noise and disturb the neighbourhood , but it would 
be impractical to impose a tax on those who make noise after a hard -days night.  
Administration costs have prevented the extension of congestion charge to smaller cities 
like Manchester – even though in principle it would make economic sense to have a 
charge for those who cause the external cost of congestion.  
4.6 GREEN BUILDING or GREEN CONSTRUCTION  OR SUSTAINABLE BUILDING  
"A green building is one which uses less water, optimizes  energy efficiency, conserves 
natural resources, generates less waste and provides healthier spaces for occupants, as 
compared to a conventional building."  
Green construction  or sustainable building  refers to a structure and using process that is 
environmentally responsible and resource -efficient throughout a building's life -cycle: from siting 
to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and dem olition.  
Objectives:  
  Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources  
  Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity  
  Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation  
 
Buildings can be rated for their environmentally sustainable construction. One such rating  
system is the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).  
This building rating system was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (GBC)  
The other rating systems are  BREEAM (Building Research Establishment's Environmental 
Assessment  method -United Kingdom) and CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for 
Building Environmental  Efficiency -Japan) help consumers determine a structure’s level of 
environmental performance.  
 
 
 
What is LEED?  110 
 Leadership in Energy and Environmental D esign (LEED) is a rating system devised by the 
United States Green Building Council (USGBC) to evaluate the environmental performance of a 
building and encourage market transformation towards sustainable design.  
The system is credit -based, allowing projec ts to earn points for environmentally friendly actions 
taken during construction and use of a building.  
 What types of buildings can use LEED?  
LEED certification is available for all building types including new construction and major 
renovation; existing buildings; commercial interiors; core and shell; schools and homes. LEED 
systems for neighborhood development, retail and healthcare are currently pilot testing. To date, 
there is over 4.5 billion square feet of construction space invo lved with the LEED system.  
How does LEED work?  
LEED is a point based system where building projects earn LEED points for satisfying specific 
green building criteria. Within each of the seven LEED credit categories, projects must satisfy 
particular prerequi sites and earn points.  
The rating system addresses six major areas:  
1. Sustainable sites;  
2. Water  efficiency;  
3. Energy and atmosphere;  
4. Materials and resources;  
5. Indoor environmental quality; and  
6. Innovation and design process.  
 
LEED certification levels : 
 four progressive levels according to the following scale:  
Certified 40 –49 points  
Silver 50 –59 points  
Gold 60 –79 points  
Platinum 80 points and above  
In 2004, the European Commission initiated the Green Building Program (GBP). This program 
aims at improving the energy efficiency and expanding the integration of renewable energies in 
non-residential buildings in Europe on a voluntary basis.  
Green building materials offer specific benefits to the building owner and building occupants:  
• Reduced maintena nce/replacement costs over the life of the building.  
• Energy conservation.  
• Improved occupant health and productivity.  
• Lower costs associated with changing space configurations.  
• Greater design flexibility.  111 
 Green building material/product selection criteria  
1. Resource efficiency  
2. Indoor air quality  
3. Energy efficiency  
4. Water conservation  
5. Affordability  
1. Resource Efficiency can be accomplished by utilizing materials that meet the following 
criteria:  
• Recycled Content : Products with identifiable recycled content, including postindustrial 
content with a preference for postconsumer content.

irritants as demonstrated by the manufacturer through appropriate testing.  
• Minimal chemical emissions : Products that have minimal emissions of Volatile Organic 
Compounds (V OCs). Products that also maximize resource and energy efficiency while 
reducing chemical emissions.  
• Low -VOC assembly : Materials installed with minimal VOC -producing compounds, or 
no-VOC mechanical attachment methods and minimal hazards.  
• Moistureresistant :Products and systems that resist moisture or inhibit the growth of 
biological contaminants in buildings.  
• Healthfully maintained : Materials, components, and systems that require only simple, 
non-toxic, or low -VOC methods of cleaning.  
• Systems or equipment:  Products that promote healthy IAQ by identifying indoor air 
pollutants or enhancing the air quality.  
3. Energy Efficiency can be maximized by utilizing materials and systems that meet the 
following criteria:  
• Materials, components, and systems that help reduc e energy consumption in buildings 
and facilities.  
4. Water Conservation can be obtained by utilizing materials and systems that meet the 
following criteria:  112 
 • Products and systems that help reduce water consumption in buildings and conserve 
water in landscaped areas.  
5. Affordability  can be considered when building product life -cycle costs are comparable to 
conventional materials or as a whole, are within a pro ject-defined percentage of the overall 
budget.

4.7 GREEN COMPUTING ORGREEN IT  OR ICT SUSTAINABILITY  
Definition  :"the study and practice of designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of 
computers , servers, and associated subsystems —such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and 
networking and c ommunications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no 
impact on the environment”  
Introduction:  
The primary objective of such a program is to account for the triple bottom line (or "People, 
Planet, Profit").  
The term "green computing" was probably coined shortly after the Energy Star program began.   113 
 The goals are similar to green chemistry namely  to reduce the use of hazardous materials; 
maximize energy efficiency during the product's lifetime; and promote recyclability or 
biodegradability  of defunct products and factory waste.  
The Green Electronics Council offers the Electronic Products Environmental Assessment 
Tool  (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "green" computing systems.  
Climate Savers Computing Initiative (CSCI)  is an effort to re duce the electric power 
consumption of PCs in active and inactive states. The name stems from the World Wildlife 
Fund's Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999. The WWF is also a member of the 
Computing Initiative.  
 
In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  launched Energy Sta r, a voluntary labeling 
program that is designed to promote and recognize energy -efficiency in monitors, climate control 
equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of sleep mode  
among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development 
launched the TCO Certification  program to promote low magnet ic and electrical emissions from 
CRT -based computer displays ; this program was later exp anded to include criteria on energy 
consumption, ergonomics , and the use of hazardous materials in construction  
 
 
So why should a company promote green, or energy e ﬃcient computing?  
• Climate Change: First and foremost, conclusive research shows that CO2 and other 
emissions are  causing global climate and environmental damage  
• Savings: Green computing can lead to serious cost savings over time.  
• Reliability of Power: Energy e ﬃcient systems helps ensure healthy power systems. Also, 
more companies  are generating more of their own electricity, which fur ther motivates 
them to keep p ower consumption low.  
• Computing Power Consumption has Reached a Critical Point: Data centers have run out 
of usable power and cooling due to high densities.  
Here are some steps that can be taken:  
• Power -down the CPU and all peripherals during extended perio ds of inactivity.  
• Try to do computer -related tasks during contiguous, intensive blocks of time, leaving 
hardware off at other times.  
• Power -up and power -down energy -intensive peripherals such as laser printer s according 
to need.  
• Use liquid -crystal -display ( LCD ) monitors rather than cathode -ray-tube ( CRT ) monitors.  
• Use notebook computers rather than desktop computer s whenever possible.  
• Use the power -management features to turn off hard drive s and displays after several 
minutes of inactivity.  
• Minimize the use of paper and properly recycle waste paper.  
• Dispose of e -waste according to federal, state and local re gulations.  
• Employ alternative energy sources for computing workstation s, servers, network s and 
data center s. 
Approaches to green computing  
 
1. Virtualization  
Computer virtualization is the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one 
set of physical ha rdware. The concept originated with the mainframe operating systems of the  114 
 1960s,  but was commercialized for  x86-compatible computers only in the  1990s. With 
virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual 
machine s on one single, powerful system, t hereby unplugging the original hardware and 
reducing power and cooling consumption.  
Eg:Intel Corporation and AMD  
 
2. Power  management  
The Advanced Configuration and Power Inte rface (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an 
operating system to direc tly control the power saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This 
allows a system to automatically turn off components such as monitors and ha rd drives after set 
periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may hi bernate, where most components (including the 
CPU and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor  to an earlier Intel -Microsoft 
standard cal led Advanced Power Management, which allows a computer's BIOS to control 
power management functions.  
Some programs allow the user to manually adjus t the voltages supplied to the CPU, which 
reduces both the amount of  heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called under 
volting . Some CPUs can automatically under volt the processor depending on the workload.  
 
3. Low  performance computers  
As of 2007, several personal computer v endors (e.g., Everex, Linutop, Systemax, Zonbu and 
OLPC) ship dedicated low -power PCs. These systems  provide minimal hardware peripherals 
and low performance processors,  which makes them impractical for applications that  require a 
lot of  processing power such as computer gaming and video  production. A low power PCs is 
usually much smaller tha n tra ditional desktop. The limited capacity for upgrades, low 
performance and proprietary may lead to shorter  life spans and greater difficulty in repair. Older 
laptops  may provide similar performance with low power consumption. Reusing second -hand 
laptops  may be an even more energy and  material efficient alternative to such systems.  
Routers , such as tho se compatible with the Linksys WRT54G, may be adapted for use in low 
power applications using replacement firmware.  
 
4. More efficient components  
4.1: Powe r supply:  Desktop  computer power supplies (PSUs) are generally 70 –75% efficient,  
dissipating the remaining energy as heat.  
   4.2: Storage: Smaller form factor (e.g. 2.5 inch) hard disk drives often consume less power  
than physically larger drives.  
   4.3: Display : LCD monitors typically use a cold -cathode fluorescent bulb to provide light  for  
                              the display. Some newer displays use an array of light -emitting diodes(LEDs)  
in place o f the fluores cent bulb, which reduces the amount of  electricity used  
by the display.  
 
 
 
 115 
 5. Materials recycling  
Recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and 
hexavalent chromium out of landfills, but often computers gathered through recycling drives are 
shipped to developing countries where environmental standards are less strict.  
Eg: printer cartridges, paper, and batteries  
 
 
4.8 NANOTECHNOLOGY  
Definition  
The systematic manipulation of matter on the length scale 1 -100 nm to produce useful new 
engineered structures, materials, or devices.  
Nanotechnology (NT) can be defined as the creation and use of materials, devices and  
systems in a size range of molecular and atomic scale (Nano -scale1).  
As it deals with the manipula tion of molecules it is also termed as molecular manufacturing.  
The prefix, “Nano” of Nanotechnology describes a scale nanometer.  
 
Nanometre  
A nanometre is thousand millionth of a metre (1 nm = 10 -9 m). Some practical examples for  
knowing the nanometre sca le are as follows:  
It is comparable to  
• 1/80.000 of the diameter of a human hair (Institute of Nanotechnology, 2002) or  
• 1/10.000 times the size of a bacteria (Drexler, 1986, p.11) or  
• 1000 times smaller than the present micro -metre devices or  
• 10 times the diameter of a hydrogen atom.  
An early promoter of the industrial applications of NT, Albert Franks, defined it as 'that  
area of science and technology where dimensions and tolerances in the range of 0.1nm  
to 100 nm play a critical role'  
 
Challenging Enviro nmental Issues  
• Legacy Pollutants  
– Chlorinated Solvents  
– PCBs, PAHs, Chlorinated Pesticides (e.g.DDT)  
– Lead, cadmium, chromium  
• Emerging Contaminants  
– Pharmaceuticals & Personal Care Products  
– Newer pesticides  
– Engineered Nanoparticles & their bypr oducts?  
• Common water constituents  
– Salinity, hardnes  
 
 
Potential Applications of Nanotechnology  
Most environmental applications of nanotechnology fall into three categories:  
(i)    Remediation and Mitigation  
(ii)   Pollution Prevention  
(iii)  Sensors for environmental agents  
(iv)Green nanotech  116 
 Possible applications of Nano Materials  
1.    As reactants         eg: Nano Zero Valent Iron, Nano Silver  
2.    As catalysts          eg: Nano TiO 2, Nano CeO 2 
3.    As adsorbents      eg: Carbon Nano tubes (CNTs), Mag -PCMAs  
4.    As sensors            eg:  CNTs (Carbon nano tubes)  
 
 
 
 Remediation  and Mitigation:  
Contamination of subsurface soil and groundwater by organic and inorganic contaminants is an 
extensive and vexing environmen tal problem that stands to benefit from nanotechnology.  
Nanotechnology offers the ability to effectively enable contaminant treatment in situ and ex -situ.  
The process begins with the injection of nanoparticles into a contaminated aquifer via an 
injection  well. The nanoparticles are then transported to the source of contamination by the 
groundwater flow where they then degrade the contaminant. Nanoparticles can sequester (via 
adsorptio n or complexation ), immobilizing them, or they can degrade the contaminants to less 
harmful compounds. Contaminant transformations are typically redox  reactions. When the 
nanoparticle is the oxidant or reductant, it is considered reactive.  
 
Generating less pollution during the manufacture of materials.  One example of this is how 
researchers have demonstrated that the use of silver nanoclusters as catalysts  can significantly 
reduce the polluting bypr oducts generated in the process used to manufacture propylene oxide. 
Propylene oxide is used to produce common materials such as plastics, paint, detergents and 
brake fluid.  
Producing solar cells that generate electricity at a competitive cost. Researcher s have  
demonstrated that an array of silicon nanowires embedded in a polymer  results in low cost but 
high efficiency solar cells. This, or other efforts using nanotechnol ogy to improve solar cells , 
may result in solar cells that generate electricity as cost effectively as coal or oil.  
Increasing the electricity generated by windmills.  Epoxy containing carbon nanotubes is being 
used to make windmill blades . The resulting blades are stronger and lower weight and therefore 
the amount of electricity generated by each windmill is greater .  
117 
 Cleaning up of organic chemicals polluting groundwater . Researchers have shown that iron 
nano particles  can be effective in cleaning up organic solvents that are polluting groundwater. 
The nano particles disperse throughout the body of water  and decompose the organic solvent in 
place this method can be more effective and cost significantly less than treatme nt methods that 
require the water to be pumped  out of the ground.  
 Capturing carbon -dioxide in power plant exhaust . Researchers are developing nanostructers 
membrane designed to capture carbondioxide in the exhaust stacks of power plants instead of 
releasing it into the air.  
Clearing volatile organic compounds (VOC ) from air . Researchers have de monstrated a 
catalyst that breaks down VOCs at room temperatue . The catalyst is composed of porous 
manganese oxide in which gold nano particles can be embed ded. 
Reducing the cost of fuel cells : changing the space of platinum atoms used in a fuel cell 
increases the catalytic ability of the platinum . This allows the fuel cell to function with about 
80%, less platinum significantly reducing the cost of fuel cell. 
Storing hydr ogen for fuel cell powered cars : Using grapheme layers to increase the binding 
energy of hydrogen to the graphene surface in a fuel tank results in higher amount of hydrogen 
storage and a lighter weight fuel tank. This could help in the d evelopment of practical hydrogen 
fueled cars. 
 
 
4.9 ISO 14000  
 
The ISO is a specialized international organization whose members are the national standards 
bodies of 111 countries.  
• All standards developed by ISO are voluntary  
• ISO 14000 is a series of international standards on environmental management.  
• "ISO 14000" is the first international attempt to standardize environmental management 
practices around the worl d. 
• ISO 14000 will help integrate the environmental management systems of companies that trade 
with each other in all corners of the world.  
 
Scope and Status of ISO 14000  
 
Organization Standards that can be used to implement and evaluate the environmental 
management system (EMS) within an organization. Included are:  
– the ISO 14000 series of EMS standards;  
– the ISO 14010 series of environmental auditing standards; and  
– the ISO 14030 series of standards for environmental performance evaluation.  
Product Standards that can be used to evaluate environmental impacts from products and 
processes. Included in this subgroup are:  
– the ISO 14020 series of environmental labeling standards;  
– the ISO 14040 series of life -cycle analysis standards; and  
– the ISO 14060 series of product standards . 
 
Environmental Labeling  
    – Type I programs are referred to as "practitioner “programs which are product or product 
category based, similar to the Environmental Choice Program or Germany's Blue Angel Program.  118 
  – Type II programs are based on common te rms and definitions which ca n be used for self -
declared claims.  
– Type III programs are based on a "report card “concept , much like existing nutrition labels.  
 
 
4.10ROLE OF IT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH  
 
Technology has played a key role in the development of human society. Modern technologies 
such as information technology  have changed the human lifestyle. Development of sophisticated 
instruments like computers, satellites, telecommunication instruments etc have resulted in total 
revolution in almost all spheres of life.  
 
The important role of information technology in envi ronment and human health are as follows:  
 
1. Remote  sensing:  Remote Sensing according to Campbell(1987) is the science of deriving 
information about the earth’s land water areas form images acquired at a distance. It relies upon 
measurement of electromagne tic energy reflected or emitted from  the features of interest.  
Regardless of the orientation of the various definitions of Remote Sensing, the acquisition of 
images of earth surface features, using sensors, through the electromagnetic spectrum, the 
synopti c view advantage and Remote Sensing’s ability to provide data for scientific 
technological and sustainable management and monitoring of the environment offer a 
convergence.  
The Electro -magnetic spectrum (EMS) is the physical basis for Remote Sensing. It is  an abstract 
idea and diagram of forms of electromagnetic energy for illuminating earth surface features. The 
source of energy is divided according to wavelengths.  
 
Steps:  
Briefly stated, the process of Remote Sensing involves  
1) Making  observation using  sensors (camera, scanners, radiometers, radar, and lasers) mounted 
on platforms (ground, aircraft, satellites, balloons) which may be at considerable height from the 
earth surface.  
2)Then, recording the observations on a suitable medium (photographic fil ms and magnetic 
tapes) or transmitting/down linking the data to a ground receiving station where the data are 
corrected for geometric and radiometric distortions.  
3) Output products can be provided in computer compatible tapes (CC T) for users that made 
requests for the data. Remote sensing serves as a tool for environmental resources (biotic, abiotic 
and cultural) assessment and monitoring. Remote sensing has some fundamental advantages that 
make it a veritable tool in environmental monitoring and manageme nt and impact studies.  
 
2. GIS (GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM)  
 
GIS and Environmental Impacts Assessment:  
Tomlin (199O) defines a GIS as ‘a configuration of computer hardware and software specially 
designed for the acquisition, maintenance and use of cartographic data’.  
GIS as a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing and retrieving at will, transformin g and 
displaying spatial data from the real world.  
The point of note is that a GIS is a computer -assisted system for the acquisition, storage, analysis 
and display of geographically are spatially referenced data. GIS is indeed a new application -119 
 based fiel d that has lend itself to varieties of human endeavors ranging from business, facility 
management to environmental management and resource application areas. Eedy (1995) has 
described GIS as a veritable tool in environmental assessment because it:  
• Stores  large multidisciplinary datasets.  
• Identify complex interrelationship between environmental characteristics.  
• Evaluate changes over time.  
• Can be systematically updated and used for more than one project.  
• Serve as a dataset for a variety of mathematical models.  
• Store and mampulate3D in addition to 2D files.  
• Serve the interests of the general public as well as technical analyst.  
 
Capabilities of GIS:  
GIS also have the capability for site impact prediction (SIP), wider area prediction (WAP) , 
cumulative effect analysis (CEA), and environmental audits and for generating trend analysis 
within an environment.  
Rodriquez -Bachiller (1995) commenting on its application in ETA studies submits that it is a 
veritable tool for generating terrain maps for slope and drainage analysis, land resources 
information system for land management, soil information system, geo scientific modeling of 
geological formations, disaster planning related to geographically localized catastrophe 
monitoring development, con tamination and pollution monitoring, flood studies, linking of 
environmental database and constructing global database for environmental modeling.  
 
Erickson (1994) suggested 4 four ways of using GIS for EIA. These are:  
• Overlay method: This involves over laying of different layers of interest of the study area  
                                   to achieve the needed result.  
• Checklist method: This is the listing of environmental components, attributes and  
                                      processes categorized under different groups.  
• Matrix method: This is the relating of specific project activities to specific types of  
                                    impacts.  
• Network method: This defines a network of possible impacts that may be triggered b y  
                                   project activities. It involves project actions, direct and indirect impacts.  
 
Use of GIS in EIA  
1 .In Project definition : During project identification and definition, the project proponent 
conducts feasibility studie s and defines the usefulness of the study. GIS can be very well used for 
defining the project by showing the location of the project and its need can be established  
with respect to other geographical identities like source of raw material, market for selli ng, 
source of labourer, climatic conditions favorable for the project etc.  
2. In evaluating environmental and visual impacts : 
Using GIS various types of visual impacts can be evaluated like, how a road will look like? How 
much portion of the road will be v isible from a particular point? By using DEM we can calculate 
and visualize the impact on ground levels either in filling or cutting and area of quarries etc 
(Oterholm, 1999).  
3 .In scoping system:  GIS can serve as a basis for scoping of environmental effe cts. Once the 
basic databases are available, a GIS based system may provide better -targeted guidelines for EIS. 
A centralized institutional scoping structure, where by EIS guidelines are issued by a single 
entity, is found to be important for the operation  of such a system as it can enjoy the  Economies  120 
 of scale and scope involved in setting up and operating a GIS system for scoping purpose 
(Haklay et al., 1998).  
4. In impact significance determination : A spatial impact assessment methodology based on 
the assumption that the importance of environmental impact is dependent, among other things, 
on the spatial distribution of the effects and of the affected environment. For each environmental 
component like - air, water, biological resources etc., impact indice s are calculated based on the 
spatial distribution of impacts (Antunes et al., 2001). The fact that GIS is not used in practice to 
the extent that it could be used in principle may also be the due to a number of limitations of GIS 
like: 
Ø Availability of d igital data  
Ø Cost of start up  
Ø System maintenance  
Ø Database construction  
Ø Availability of hardware and software  
 
3. National management Information system ( NIMS ) - database for research and development  
 
4. Environmental  Information system (ENVIS): It was been created by MoEF in India for 
generating network of database for pollution control, clean technologies etc.  
Database:  Database is the collection of inter -related data on various subjects in computerized 
form which ca n be retrieved whenever required. Now the data regarding birth and death rates, 
immunization and sanitation programs can be maintained more accurately than before in 
computers at health centers. Database is also available about the diseases like malaria, f luorosis, 
AIDS etc. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India has taken up the task 
of compiling a database on various environmental issues like wildlife, forests cover, wasteland 
etc. 
 
3. Human health:  Information technology also plays a key role in human health. It helps the 
doctors to monitor the health of people of that area. The information regarding outbreak of 
epidemic diseases from remote areas can be sent more quickly to the district administration to 
take corrective measures. No w, patients can seek help of a super specialist doctor placed at far 
off distance. Many hospitals now, take on -line help of experts to provide better treatment and 
services to their patients. This has become possible only because of advancement of IT in th e 
recent  times.

5.1ENVIRONMENTAL EHICS  
 
Excessive rise in population, rampant industrialization and rapid growth in industrial sectors has 
led to a great deterioration of Indian environment. However, Environmental management is now 
accepted as a major guiding factor for National Development in India. Over the last few decades 
there has been a progressive & strengthening of official involvement in environmen tal 
management with increased scientific technical, administrative and legislative back up at the 
central and state levels.  
 
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

contravention.  
(2) If the failure or contravention continues beyond a period of one year after the date of 
conviction, the offender shall be punishable with  imprisonment for a term which may extend to

5.1.2 THE AIR (PREVENTION & CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT  
It is also a comprehensive legislation with more than fifty sections. It makes provisions, inter 
alia, for Central and State Boards, power to declare pollution control areas, restrictions on certain 
industrial units, authority of the Boards to limit emission of air pollutants, power of entry, 
inspection, taking samples and analysis, penalties, offences by  companies and Government and 
cognizance of offences etc.  
 
The Act specifically empowers State Government to designate air pollution areas and to 
prescribe the type of fuel to be used in these designated areas. According to this Act, no person 
can operate  certain types of industries including the asbestos, cement, fertilizer and petroleum 
industries without consent of the State Board. The Board can predicate its consent upon the 
fulfillment of certain conditions. The Air Act apparently adopts an industry w ide “best available 
technology” requirement. As in the Water Act, courts may hear complaints under the Act only at 
the instigation of, or with the sanction of, the State Board.  
The Government passed this Act in 1981 to clean up our air by controlling pollu tion. It states that 
sources of air pollution such as industry, vehicles, power plants, etc., are not permitted to release 
particulate matter, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) or other toxic substance s beyond a prescribed level. To ensure this, 
Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) have been set up by Government to measure pollution levels in 
the atmosphere and at certain sources by testing the air. This is measured in parts per million or 
in milligrams or m icrograms per cubic meter. The particulate matter and gases that are released 
by industry and by cars, buses and two wheelers is measured by using air -sampling equipment. 
However, the most important aspect is for people themselves to appreciate the dangers  of air 
pollution and reduce their own potential as polluters by seeing that their own vehicles or the 
industry they work in reduces levels of emissions. This Act is created to take appropriate steps 
for the preservation of the natural resources of the Ear th which among other things includes the 
preservation of high quality air and ensures controlling the level of air pollution.  
The main objectives of the Act are as follows:  
(a) To provide for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution.  
(b) To provide for the establishment of central and State Boards with a view to implement the 
Act. 
(C) To confer on the Boards the powers to implement the provisions of the Act and assign to the 
Boards functions relating to pollution  
Air pollution is more acute i n heavily industrialized and urbanized areas, which are also densely 
populated. The presence of pollution beyond certain Limits due to various pollutants discharged 
through industrial emission is monitored by the PCBs set up in every state.  
 
Powers and Fun ctions of the Boards  
Central Pollution Board:  The main function of the Central Board is to implement legislation 
created to improve the quality of air and to prevent and control air pollution in the country. The 125 
 Board advises the Central Government on matt ers concerning the improvement of air quality and 
also coordinates activities, provides technical assistance and guidance to State Boards and lays 
down standards for the quality of air. It collects and disseminates information in respect of 
matters relatin g to air pollution and performs functions as prescribed in the Act.  
 
State Pollution Control Boards : The State Boards have the power to advise the State 
Government on any matter concerning the prevention and control of air pollution. They have the 
right to  inspect at all reasonable times any control equipment, industrial plant, or manufacturing 
process and give orders to take the necessary steps to control pollution.  
 
They are expected to inspect air pollution control areas at intervals or whenever necessar y. They 
are empowered to provide standards for emissions to be laid down for different industrial plants 
with regard to quantity and composition of emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere. A 
State Board may establish or recognize a laboratory to per form this function. The State 
Governments have been given powers to declare air pollution control areas after consulting with 
the State Board and also give instructions to ensure standards of emission from automobiles and 
restriction on use of certain indu strial plants.  
 
Penalties:  The persons managing industry are to be penalized if they produce emissions  of air 
pollutants in excess of the standards laid down by the State Board. The Board also  makes 
applications to the court for restraining persons causing  air pollution. Whoever contravenes any 
of the provision of the Act or any order or direction issued is punishable  with imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to three months or with a fine of Rs 10,000 or with both, and in case of 
continuing offence wit h an additional fine which may extend to Rs 5,000 for every day during 
which such contravention continues after conviction for the first contravention.  
 
5.1.3 THE WATER (PREVENTION & CONTROL OF POLLUTION) ACT  
 
The government formulated this act in 1974 to prevent the pollution of water by industrial, 
agricultural and household wastewater that can contaminate our water sources.  
 
Wastewaters with high levels of pollutants that enter wetlands, rivers, lakes, wells as well  as the 
sea are serious health hazar ds. Controlling the point sources by monitoring the  levels of different 
pollutants is one way to prevent pollution, by punishing the polluter.  Individuals can also do 
several things to reduce water pollution such as using biodegradable chemicals for household 
use, reducing the use of pesticides in gardens, and identifying polluting sources at work places 
and in industrial units where oil are or other petroleum products and heavy metals are used. 
Excessive organic matter, sediments and infecting organi sm from hospital wastes can also 
pollute our water. Citizen needs to develop a watchdog force to inform authorities to appropriate 
actions against different types of water pollution. However, preventing pollution is better than 
trying to cure the problems it has created, or punishing offenders.  
 
The main objectives of the Water Act are to provide for prevention, control and abatement of 
water pollution and the maintenance or restoration n of the wholesomeness of water. It is 
designed to assess pollution lev els and punish polluters. The Central Government and State 
Government have set up PCBs to monitor water pollution.  
 126 
 The Water Act 1974 with certain amendments in 1978 is an extensive legislation with more than 
sixty sections for the prevention and control of water pollution. Among other things, the Act 
provides for constitution of central and State Boards for preventing water pollution, power to 
take water samples and their analysis, discharge of sewage or trade effluents, appeals, revision, 
minimum and max imum penalties, publication of names of offenders, offences by companies 
and Government departments, cognizance of offences, water laboratories, analysis etc. 
Prevention and control of water pollution is achieved through a permit or ‘consent 
administration ’ procedure. Discharge of effluents is permitted by obtaining the consent of the 
State Water Board, subject to any condition they specify. Any person who fails to comply with a 
directive of the State cannot, however, entertain in suit under this Act unless  the suit is brought 
by, or with the sanction of the State Board.  
 
WATER POLLUTION CESS ACT 1977  
 
According to this Act, anyone consuming water has to pay certain amount of cess depending on 
1. Whether the industry is using water for industrial cooling, sp raying in mine pits or boilers 
feed,  
2. For domestic purposes,  
3. in processing, whereby water gets polluted and pollutants are easily biodegradable, and  
4. in processing whereby water gets polluted and the pollutants are not easily bio -degradable and 
are toxic. Those industries that had installed a suitable treatment plant for the treatment of 
industrial effluents can get a rebate of 70 per cent on the cess payable.  
 
5.1.4 WILD LIFE PROTECTION ACT  
 
The Act is adopted by all states in India except J&K, w hich has its own Act  
The act is aimed to protect and preserve wild life. Wild life refers to all animals and plants that 
are not domesticated. India has rich wild life heritage; it has 350 species of mammals, 1200 
species of birds and about 20,000 known sp ecies of insects. Some of them are listed as 
‘endangered species’ in the Wild life (Protection) Act. The Act envisages national parks and wild 
life sanctuaries as protected areas to conserve wild life. Wild life populations are regularly 
monitored and mana gement strategies formulated to protect them.  
The Act covers the rights and non -rights of forest dwellers too, - it provides restricted grazing in 
sanctuaries but prohibits in national parks. It also prohibits the collection of non -timber forest 
produce whi ch might not harm the system. The rights of forest dwellers recognized by the Forest 
policy of 1988 are taken away by the Amended Wild life Act of 1991.  
The act, a landmark in the history of wildlife legislation in our country by which wildlife was 
transfe rred from State list to concurrent list in 1976, thus giving power to the Central 
Government to enact the legislation. In India, nearly 134 animal species have been regarded as 
threatened. A National Wildlife action plan has been prepared whose objective i s to establish a 
network of scientifically managed areas such as national parks, sanctuaries and biosphere 
reserves, to cover representative and viable samples of all significant bio -geographic 
subdivisions within the country.  
 
The major activities and pro visions in the act can be summed up as follows:  
1. It defines the wildlife related terminology.  
2. It provides for the appointment of wildlife advisory board, wildlife warden, their powers,  
      duties etc  127 
 3. Under the Act, comprehensive listing of endangered wildlife species was done for the first  
     time and prohibition of hunting of the endan gered species was mentioned  
4. Protection to some endangered plants like Beddome cycad, Blue Vanda, Ladies Sliper Orchid,  
     Pitcher plant etc. is also provided under the Act.  
5. The act provides for setting up of National Parks, Wild life Sanctuaries e tc. 
6. The Act provides for the constitution of Central Zoo Authority.  
7. There is provision for trade and commerce in some wildlife species with license for sale,  
     possession, transfer etc.  
8. The Act imposes a ban on the trade or commerce in schedul ed animals.  
9. It provides for legal powers to officers and punishment of offenders.  
10. It provides for captive breeding programme for endangered species. Several conservation  
       projects for individual endangered species like lion (1972), tiger (197 3), crocodile (1974),  
       and brown antlered deer (1981) were started under this Act.  
 
 
5.1.5 FOREST CONSERVATION ACT  
 
The Indian Forest Act of 1927 consolidated all the previous laws regarding forests that were 
passed before the 1920s. The Act gave th e Government and Forest Department the power to 
create Reserved Forests, and the right to use Reserved Forests for Government use alone.  
It also created Protected Forests, in which the use of resources by local people was controlled. 
Some forests were to be controlled by the village community, and these were called village 
Forests. The Act remained in force till the 1980s when it was realized that protecting forests for 
timber production alone was not acceptable. The other values of protecting the services  that 
forests provide and its valuable assets such as biodiversity began to overshadow the importance 
of their revenue earnings from timber.  
This led to the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 and its amendment 1988. India’s first Forest 
Policy was enunciated  in 1952. Between 1952 and 1988, the extent of deforestation was so great 
that it became essential to formulate a new policy on forests and their utilization. The earlier 
forest policies had focused only on revenue generation. In the 1980’s it became clear  that forests 
must be protected for their other functions such as the maintenance of soil and water regimes 
centered around ecological concerns. It also provided for the use of goods and services of the 
forest for its local inhabitants.  
The new policy fram ework made conversion of forests into other uses much less possible. 
Conservation of the forests as a natural heritage finds a place in the new policy, which includes 
the preservation of its biological diversity and genetic resources. It also values meetin g the needs 
of local people for food, fuel wood, fodder and Non Timber Forest Produce or NTFPs. It gives 
priority to maintaining environmental stability and ecological balances. It expressly states that 
the network of Protected Areas should be strengthened  and extended.  
 
The Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was enacted to control deforestation, It ensured that 
forestlands could not be de -reserved without prior approval of the Central Government, This was 
created as some states had begun to dereserve the Rese rved Forests for non -forest use. These 
states had regularized encroachments and resettled ‘project Affected people’ from development 
projects such as dams in these de -reserved areas. The need for a new legislation became urgent. 
The Act made it possible to  retain a greater control over the frightening level of deforestation in 
the country and specified penalties for offenders.  
 128 
 Penalties for offences in Reserved Forests:  
• No person is allowed to make clearing or ser fire to a reserved forest. Cattle are not permitted 
to trespass into the reserved forest, cutting, collecting of timber, bark or leaves, quarrying or 
collecting any forest products is punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months or with a 
fine which may extended to Rs 500 or both.  
Penalties for offences in protected Forests:  
• A person who commits any of the following offences like cutting of trees, stripping the bark or 
leaves of trees, set fire to such forests or permits cattle to damage any tree, shall be punishable 
with imprisonmen t for a term which may extended to six months or with a fine which any 
extended to Rs 500 or both.  
• Any forest officer even without an order from the magistrate or a warrant can arrest any person 
against whom a reasonable suspicion exists.  
 
5.1.6 ISSUES I NVOLVED IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
LEGISLATION -PUBLIC AWARENESS  
 
It is necessary to create awareness about the norms and projected environmental restrictions 
under which organization may have environmental regulation s and legislations rests with a 
number of different agencies. Central government is respons ible for enforcement of various 
environmental legislation for less polluting small scale industries.  There is an urgent need to use 
a range of measures to complement  regulations.  
It should be a must for all potential polluters to apply permission to operate, discharge or emit 
any pollutants. In addition there should be a greater monitoring. The technique of environmental 
assessment is applied to ensure that the signif icance of pot ential environmental impacts of 
proposed projects are critically examined during the planning process. Another way of increasing 
awareness on environmental protection is the introduction of voluntary scheme under which 
companies which would me et certain standard of environmental property of their products.  
The various expectations in different types of pollution are as follows:  
1. Water Pollution:  
Under the water resource act of the country it should be criminal offence to cause or knowingly 
permit the entry in to controlled water of any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter or any other 
solid matter, trade or sewage effluent without the consent. Accidental spillage or discharge of 
such materials should be treated as an offence.  
2. Air Pollutio n: 
The legal responsibility about air pollution may be found in terms of the environmental 
protection act, covering two complementary systems of air pollution (1) the most potentially 
polluting activities. The major sources of air pollution are (a) Emissio n from industrial sources 
(b) Emission from motors vehicles, (c) Emission from other sources.  
Thus, to prevent air pollution, rules and regulations are required to be framed.  129 
 3. Wastes Disposal : 
They may be regulatory bodies for waste disposal, waste colle ction. These should also be 
directives relating to waste on the disposal of waste oil, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl, 
and polychlorinated phenyls.  
After the united Nation's Conference on Human Environment in 1972 the Environmental 
legislation go t a fresh impieties Indian first systematic approach in dealing with the 
environmental issues started from water Act of 1974. This Act was amended in 1988 and a new 
section 33 A was introduced which empowers state boards to issue directives to any person t o 
close any industry and to stop or regulate supply of water and electricity. Because of the 
continuing environmental degradation and the Bhopal gas tragedy in 1974 the central 
government enacted fresh legislation for adopting more strict environmental pol icies.  
Environmental Protection Act 1986 is one of the most significant legislation to protect the 
environment. Under Article 48A, the addition was made to the directive principles of state policy 
as the state shall endeavors to protect and improve the env ironment and safeguard the forests and 
wildlife of the country. Article 51A (g| imposes high responsibility on every citizen to protect the 
environment and improve natural resources, including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife.  
Every citizen has a choice  of few records to mitigate pollution. These are (1) a common law and 
action (2) a writ petition for completing the agency to enforce the law and (3) a citizen suit.  
An upcoming industry must submit No Objection Certificate in respect of pollution before i t 
starts the implementation process. In case of a large project, it should submit Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to the Govt. of India for 
final clearance of the project.  
Recently Supreme Court of India emphas ized on the need to strengthen some institutional 
machinery to enforce antipollution law across the state. Supreme Court has further suggested that 
Government should set up special courts exclusively to deal with cases relating to violation of 
environmenta l laws. Supreme Court has also suggested that chemical industries should be treated 
separately. In 1996, Supreme Court has ordered Union Government and local authorities to keep 
clean the historical places on a regular basis.  
AWARENES : 
It is evident that t he growing number of poor people, in developing countries due to the rapid 
population growth complex with economic constraints contributes to the degradation of 
environment and the renewable to the degradation of environment and the renewable sources like 
water, forests, and extinction of various species on which the man depends.  
For these, greater awareness is needed. Due care is necessary to harness the natural resources, so 
that the quality of the environment does not deteriorate. It is unfortunate to no te that degradation 
of environment continues inspire of environmental legislations and standard ization. One of the 
reasons for this is improper implementation of the various environmental laws and standards. 
The most important reason may lack of awareness  and understanding the implicate 
environmental degradation.  130 
  
5.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT  
 
Definition of Impact : An impact can be defined as any change in physical, chemical, biological, 
cultural or socio -economic environmental s ystem as a result of activities  relating to a project or 
adverse effects caused by industrial, infrastructural projects or by the release of a substance into 
the environment.  
 
Definition of Impact Assessment : Impact assessment is the process of identifying the future  
consequences (bad results) of a proposed project. Impact Assessment ensures that projects, 
programs and policies are economical ly viable, socially equitable and environmentally 
sustainable.  
 
Definition of Environmental Impact Assessment: The United Nations of Environmental 
Programme (UNEP ) defined that EIA is a tool used to identify the environmental and economic 
impacts of a project prior to decision making regarding the project planning, de sign, adverse 
impacts, etc.. For all proposed and development projects, whether Government or Private, the  
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) requires an Environmental impact assessment 
report related to the following parameters:  
The report must de fine what impact it would have on water; soil and air including flora and 
fauna. Affect on the lives of local people.  
To ensure that no way harm the environment on a short term or long term basis.  
 
Why is EIA important?  
By identifying potential alternative s and adverse impacts, Nations can better achieve goals for 
sustainable development; avoid adverse environmental; social and cultural impacts; reduces cost, 
provides better plan for infrastructure etc ... 
 
CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS : 
Environment impacts aris ing from any development projects fall into three categories:  
(i) Direct impacts  
(ii) Indirect impacts and  
(iii) Cumulative impacts.  
According to their nature, these three groups reveal:  
 Positive and negative impacts  
 Reversible and irreversible impacts  
 Light, moderate and severe impacts  
 Local and widespread impacts  
 Short – term and long – term impacts  
For eg to construct a major project:  
Direct impacts are related  to: 
(a) Aesthetics in the area (understanding of beautiful thin gs); 
 (b) Traffic at nearby junctions,  
(c) Removal of natural vegetation;  
(d) Interference with natural water ways;  
(e) Additional housing or commercial shops to support employees.  
 
 131 
 SIGNIFICANCE OF EFFECTS:  
Significant effects are likely to occur wher e valuable resources are subject to impacts of severity. 
EIA is recognized by adopting the five levels of significance as described in the draft to good 
practice and procedures. These five levels of significances are::  
Severe: Sites of national importance and unique resources ( to exist in only one place ) if lost,  
               cannot be replaced or relocated.  
Major: These effects are to be important considerations at a regional or district scale during  
               the decision making process..  
Moderate: These effects at a local scale are likely to be key decision making issues.  
Minor: These effects may be raised a s local issues but are unimportant in the decision making  
                process.  
Neutral: No effect, not significant.  
 
5.2.1 BASELINE DATA ACQUISITION  
 
Baseline information is important reference point for conducting EIA. The term "baseline" refers 
to the collection of background information on the biophysical, social and economic settings 
proposed project area. An  Environmental Baseline Study (EBS) is an investigation conducted to 
establish the level of contaminants in the project areas and to assess th e extent of contamination. 
The information needed to conduct an EBS can be acquired from the available sources:  
 
Baseline data are collected for two main purposes : 
• To provide a description of the status and trends of environmental factors (e.g., air 
pollut ant concentrations) against which predicted changes can be compared and evaluated 
in terms of importance, and  
• To provide a means of detecting actual change by monitoring once a project has been 
initiated  
Land features include topography; climatology ( temperature, rainfall )  
Geology & Hydrogeology (Lithology of rock formations, drainage pattern, ground water table)  
Air environment (study of SPM, SOx; NOx )  
Noise environment  
Water Environment (PH; TDS; F; dissolved Oxygen; BOD etc..)  
Soil q uality Soil analysis reflect the presence of nutrients like N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Al  
Flora and Fauna of the proposed area  
Socio economic study include Population density; Literacy rate; Category of workers viz., 
cultivators, agriculture laborers, etc); Medical facilities; Main sources of availability of water  
viz., rivers, canals, hand pumps, taps etc..  
 
5.2.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROCESS  
 
Following are the steps involved in a systematic EIA of a highway project:  
1. Project def inition:  The importance and need of the project is defined here and its relation 
with regional and national developmental activity is mentioned in this section.  
 
2. Screening:  Screening is done as per the statutory notification. Screening criteria are base d 
upon:  
Ø Scales of investment;  
Ø Type of development; and  
Ø Location of development  132 
  
3. Scoping:  Scoping is a process of detailing the terms of reference of EIA. It is done by the 
consultant in consultation with the project proponent and guidance, if needed, from Impact 
Assessment Agency. Quantifiable impacts will be assessed based on magnitude, prev alence, 
frequency and duration and non -quantifiable impacts (such as aesthetic or recreational value).  
Significance is commonly determined through the socioeconomic criteria. After that the areas, 
where the project could have significant impact are identif ied and the baseline status of these will 
be monitored and then the likely changes in these on account of the construction and operation of 
the proposed project will be predicted.  
 
4. Baseline information:  Baseline data describes the existing environmental  status of the 
identified study area. The site -specific primary data is monitored for the identified parameters 
and supplemented by secondary data if available.  
 
5. Impact prediction:  Impact prediction is a way of mapping the environmental consequences 
of the significant aspects of the project and its alternative. Environmental impact can never be 
predicted with absolute certainty and this is all the more reason to consider all possible factors 
and take all possible precautions for reducing the degree of un certainty.  
 
6. Evaluation of impacts and alternative criteria:  For the project possible alternatives are 
identified and environmental attributes are compared. These alternatives cover both project 
location and process technologies. Alternatives consider .n o project. also. Alternatives are  
then ranked for selection of the best environmental option for optimum economic benefits to the 
community at large.  
 
7. Management plan:  This section of the EIA will describe about the mitigation measures to 
reduce the har mful effects of the proposed project. Particularly, it will also contain the provision 
for rehabilitation of the people affected and displaced by the project.  
 
8. Public participation:  Law requires that the public must be informed and consulted on a 
propos ed development after the completion of EIA report. Public participation can be assured by:  
i. Consulting the public directly affected by the proposed project and the voluntary groups like     
    NGOs or pressure groups having a concern with a specific asp ect of the environment.  
ii. Conducting direct interviews with the sample from public or by sending questionnaire to the  
     people from public.  
iii. Publishing the summary of EIA report for objections and suggestions from people.  
 
9. Decision making:  Decision making process involves the consultation between the project 
proponent (assisted by a consultant) and the assessment authority (assisted by an expert group if 
necessary). The final decision on acceptance, rejection or clearance is arrived at through a 
number of steps including evaluation of EIA and environmental management plan.  
 
10. Monitoring Plan:  Monitoring should be done both during construction and operation phases 
of a project. Monitoring will enable the regulatory agency to review the validity  of predictions 
and the conditions of implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.

 5.2.3 METHODS FOR IMPACT IDENTIFICATION  
 
INTRODUCTION:  
 
A logical and systematic approach needs to be taken to impact identification. The aim is to take 
account of all of the important environmental/project impacts and interactions, making sure that 
indirect and cumulative effects, which may be potentially significant, are not inadvertently 
omitted.  
 
PROCESS:  
 
This process begins during screening and conti nues through scoping, which identifies the key 
issues and classifies them into impact categories for further study. In the next phase, the likely 
impacts are analyzed in greater detail in accordance with terms of reference specifically 
established for this  purpose. Over time, a number of EIA methodologies and tools have been 
developed for use in impact identification.  
 
METHODS:  
 
The most common formal methods used for impact identification are:  
 
• Checklists;   • matrices;   • networks;  
• Overlays and geogra phic information systems (GIS);  
 
A) Checklists  
Checklists annotate the environmental features or factors that need to be addressed when 
identifying the impacts of projects and activities. They can vary in complexity and purpose, from 
a simple checklist to a structured methodology or system that also assigns significance by scaling 
and weighting the impacts (such as the Battelle Environmental Evaluation System). Both simple 
and descriptive checklists can be improved and adapted to suit local con ditions as experience 
with their use is gained.  
Checklists provide a systematized means of identifying impacts. They also have been developed 
for application to particular types of projects and categories of impacts (such as dams or road 
building). Sectora l checklists often are useful when proponents specialize in one particular area 
of development.  
 
B) Matrices  
A matrix is a grid -like table that is used to identify the interaction between project activities, 
which are displayed along one axis, and environm ental characteristics, which are displayed along 
the other axis. Using the table, environment -activity interactions can be noted in the appropriate 
cells or intersecting points in the grid. ‘Entries’ are made in the cells to highlight  impact severity 
or ot her features related to the nature of the impact, for instance:  
• Ticks  or symbols can identify impact type (such as direct, indirect, cumulative) pictorially;  
• Numbers  or a range of dot sizes can indicate scale; or  
• Descriptive  comments can be made.  
 
 
 134 
 C) Networks  
Networks illustrate the cause -effect relationship of project activities and environmental 
characteristics. They are, therefore, particularly useful in identifying and depicting secondary 
impacts (indirect, cumulative, etc).  
Simplified networks,  used in conjunction with other methods, help to ensure that important 
second -order impacts are not omitted from the investigation.  
More detailed networks are visually complicated, time -consuming and difficult to produce unless 
a computer programme is used  for the task.  
However, they can be a useful aid for establishing ‘impact hypotheses’ and other structured 
science -based approaches to EIA.  
 
D) Overlays and geographic information systems  
Overlays can be used to map impacts spatially and display them pict orially. The original overlay 
technique, popularized by McHarg, is an environmental suitability analysis in which data on 
topographic features, ecological values and resource constraints are mapped onto individual 
transparencies and then aggregated into a composite representation of potential impacts. This  
approach is useful for comparing site and planning alternatives, for routing linear developments 
to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and for landscape and habitat zoning at the regional 
level.  Disadv antages: lack of precision in differentiating the likelihood and magnitude of impacts 
and relating them to project actions.  A modern version of the overlay method is the computer -
based geographical information system (GIS). In simple terms, a GIS stores, retrieves, 
manipulates and displays environmental data in a spatial format. A set of maps or overlays of a 
given area provide different types of information and scales of resolution.  The use of GIS for 
EIA purposes is not as widespread as commonly imagined . The main drawbacks are the lack of 
appropriate data and the expense of creating a usable system. However, the potential application 
of GIS to EIA is widely acknowledged and its use is expected to increase in the future, 
particularly to address cumulative  effects.

 5.2.4 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)  
Preparation of environmental management plan is required for formulation, implementation and 
monitoring of environmental protection measures during and after commissioning of projects. 
The plans should indicate the details as to how various measures have been or are proposed to be 
taken including cost components as may be required. Cost of measures for environmental 
safeguards should be treated as an integral component of the project cost and envi ronmental 
aspects should be taken into account at various stages of the projects:  
• Conceptualization: preliminary environmental assessment  
• Planning: detailed studies of environmental impacts and design of safeguards  
• Execution: implementation of environmenta l safety measures  
• Operation: monitoring of effectiveness of built -in safeguards  
The management plans should be necessarily based on considerations of resource conservation 
and pollution abatement, some of which are:  
• Liquid Effluents  
• Air Pollution  
• Solid Wastes  
• Noise and Vibration  
• Occupational Safety and Health  
• Prevention, maintenance and operation of Environment Control Systems  
• House -Keeping  
• Human Settlements  
• Transport Systems  
• Recovery - reuse of waste products  
• Vegetal Cover  
• Disaster Planning  
• Environment Mana gement Cell  
1. Liquid Effluents  
o Effluents from the industrial plants should be treated well to the standards as 
prescribed by the Central/State Water Pollution Control Boards.  
o Soil permeability studies should be made prior to effluents being discharged into 
holding tanks or impoundments and steps taken to prevent percolation and ground 
water contamination.  
o Special precautions should be taken regarding flight patterns of birds in the area. 
Effluents containing toxic compounds, oil and grease have been known to cause 
extensive death of migratory birds. Location of plants should be prohibited in 
such type of sensitive areas.  
o Deep well burial of toxic effluents should not be resorted to as it can result in re -
surfacing and ground water contamination. Re -surfacing h as been known to cause 
extensive damage to crop and livestock’s . 
o In all cases, efforts should be made for re -use of water and its conservation.  
2. Air Pollution  
o The emission levels of pollutants from the different stacks, should conform to the 
pollution contr ol standards prescribed by Central or State Boards.  136 
 o Adequate control equipment should be installed for minimizing  the emission of 
pollutants from the various stacks.  
o In-plant control measures should be taken to contain the fugitive emissions.  
o Infrastructur al facilities should be provided for monitoring the stack emissions 
and measuring the ambient air quality including micro -meteorological 
data(wherever required) in the area.  
o Proper stack height as prescribed by the Central/State Pollution Control Boards 
should be provided for better dispersion of pollutants over a wider area to 
minimize  the effect of pollution.  
o Community buildings and townships should be built up -wind of plant with one -
half to one kilometer greenbelt in addition to physiographical barrier.  
3. Solid Wastes  
o The site for waste disposal should be checked to verify permeability so that no 
contaminants percolate into the ground water or river/lake.  
o Waste disposal areas should be planned down -wind of villages and townships.  
o Reactive materials should b e disposed of by immobilizing  the reactive materials 
with suitable additives.  
o The pattern of filling disposal site should be planned to create better landscape 
and be approved by appropriate agency and the appropriately pretreated solid 
wastes should be disposed according to the approved plan.  
o Intensive programs of tree plantation on disposal areas should be undertaken.  
4. Noise and Vibration  
Adequate measures should be taken for control of noise and vibrations in the industry.  
5. Occupational Safety and Health  
Proper precautionary measures for adopting occupational safety and health standards 
should be taken.  
6. Prevention, maintenance and operation of Environment Control Systems  
o Adequate safety precautions should be taken during preventive maintenance and 
shut do wn of the control systems.  
o A system of inter -locking with the production equipment should be implemented 
where highly toxic compounds are involved.  
7. House - Keeping  
Proper house -keeping and cleanliness should be maintained both inside and outside of the 
industry.  
8. Human Settlements  
o Residential colonies should be located away from the solid and liquid waste 
dumping areas. Meteorological and environmental conditions should be studied 
properly before selecting the site for residential areas in order to avoid air  
pollution problems.  
o Persons, who are displaced or have lost agricultural lands as a result of locating 
the industries in the area, should be properly rehabilitated.  
9. Transport Systems  
o Proper parking places should be provided for the trucks and other vehicl es by the 
industries to avoid any congestion or blocking of roads.  
o Sitting  of industries on the highways should be avoided as it may add to more 
road accidents because of substantial increase in the movements of heavy vehicles 
and unauthorized shops and se ttlements coming up around the industrial complex.  137 
 o Spillage of chemicals/substances on roads inside the plant may lead to accidents. 
Proper road safety signs both inside and outside the plant should be displayed for 
avoiding road accidents.  
10. Recovery - reuse of waste products  
Efforts should be made to recycle or recover the waste materials to the extent possible. 
The treated liquid effluents can be conveniently and safely used for irrigation of lands, 
plants and fields for growing non -edible crops.  
11. Vegetal C over 
Industries should plant trees and ensure vegetal cover in their premises. This is 
particularly advisable for those industries having more than 10 acres of land.  
12. Disaster Planning  
Proper disaster planning should be done to meet any emergency situation arising due to 
fire, explosion, sudden leakage of gas etc. Firefighting  equipment and other safety 
appliances should be kept ready for use during disaster/emergency situation including 
natural calamities like earthquake/flood.  
13. Environment Management Cell  
Each industry should identify within its setup a Department/Section/Cell with trained 
personnel to take up the model responsibility of environmental management as required 
for planning and implementation of the projects  
5.2.5 ROLE OF NGOs IN THE PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT  
 
The protection of environment is a pressing issue. Every person, organization  and Institution  has 
an obligation and duty to protect it. Environmental protection encompasses  Not only pollution 
but also sustainable development and conservation of natural resources  and the ecosystem. 
Today, the necessity of environmental awareness and enforcement is  more  demanding and 
urgent than ever before.  
 
NGOs are simply agencies or groups, which are different from government bodies. However, 
NGOs are distinctive in containing a vo luntary component and also because they do not operate 
for profit. Over the past quarter of a century and especially during the past few decades there has 
been a rapid growth in the numbers of NGOs involved in the development, in the number of 
people worki ng for NGOs and in the amount of money that flows into these voluntary agencies 
working in the activities such as –Disaster management and relief, development, public health, 
rehabilitation, environment protection etc. However, this paper focuses on the ro le played by 
NGOs particularly in the protection of environment  
 
The emergence of NGOs represents an organized response by civil society especially in those 
areas in which the state has either failed to reach or done so in adequately. The importance of 
public awareness and NGOs involvement in environmental protection is acknowledged 
worldwide. NGO’s have been taking a number of steps to promote discussion and debate about 
environmental issues, outside the broad spheres of popular media and the educational s ystem.  
 
NGOs can make the following Contributions:  
• Conducting education and citizen awareness programmes in the field of environment  
• Fact – finding and analysis  
• Filing public interest litigations  
• Innovation and experimenting in areas which are difficult fo r government agencies to  138 
         make changes in  
• Providing expertise and policy analysis  
• Providing factual and reliable information with a network of professional expert staff  
• Remaining independent while passing relevant information to the public and  
         governmental bodies  
• Solidarity and support to environmental defenders  
• Working in collaboration with the government for capacity building and promotion of  
       community participation in environmental awareness and protection and  
• Working out at the grass root level and reaching far – flung areas with or without the  
government invitation . 
 
Achievements of environmental NGOs with special reference to  
 
 WWF ( India),  Teri and  Clean - India  
 
1. WWF (India) is engaged in a multitude of activities for protection and conservation of the 
environment in the Indian context. Climate change and energy conservation are among the chief 
areas of concern for the organization . The forest and biodiversity conservation div ision strives to 
promote and enhance conservation of forest ecosystems in the country through a participatory 
approach involving key stakeholders. Through its environment education programme, it aims at 
strengthening individual and institutional capacity i n nature conservation and environmental 
protection through widespread education and awareness.  
Intimately involved in the conservation of tigers in India since the late 1960s, WWF’s significant 
efforts culminated in the launch of Project Tiger in 1973. It seeks to conserve and protect the 
biodiversity of maritime life and resources by sensitizing  the people at large.  
The pollution of the river waters and the imminent threat to aquatic life is a cause of great 
concern. WWF (India) has stepped in on a number of occasions to launch campaigns for securing 
their habitat, like ‘Save the River Dolphin’ project. WWF believes that if you secure an animal’s 
habitat, you secure its right to live  
 
2. CLEAN -INDIA  
Deeply concerned with the deteriorating environmental situation in the country, Development 
Alternatives initiated the CLEAN -India (Community Led Environment Action Network) 
programme with five schools in the national capital in 1996. Today, CLEAN Delhi has about 
forty schools regularly involved  in monitoring water and air quality in over 150 locations spread 
across Delhi. Over 2000 children have been directly trained on environmental assessment and 
improvement activities. They keep vigil, assess environmental quality, plead, cajole and lead the 
community in monitoring environment. Action programmes like solid waste management, 
plantation drives, energy conservation, paper recycling, etc. to improve local environmental 
conditions have also been initiated by schools, resident welfare associations, business and 
industrial associations as well as individual households.  
Campaigns against the use of polybags, firecrackers during Diwali and toxic (chemicalbased)  
colours during Holi and for saving the city’s ‘Green Treasure’ are also carried out.  
The expe rience in Delhi indicates that when environment assessment is community based,  
it mobilises the community to review the local environmental conditions and take requisite  
measures, without waiting for undue external support.  
Encouraged by the Delhi experien ce, NGOs from different towns have operationalised the 
CLEAN -India programme. The present CLEAN -India Centers are : 139 
 Delhi, Shillong, Faizabad, Ladakh, Bangalore, Berinag (Kumaon Hills), Jhansi, Sagar, Bilaspur, 
Lalitpur, Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram. Almo st 100 NGOs from across the country have 
expressed their interest to initiate the programme in their respective towns.  
 
3. TERI (INDIA)  
Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) was formally established in 1974 with the purpose of 
tackling and dealing with the  immense and acute problems that mankind is likely to be faced 
with in the years ahead:  
On account of the gradual depletion of the earth’s finite energy resources which are largely non -
renewable and  on account of the existing methods of their use which are  polluting  TERI has 
launched a major project, the first phase of which is completing near completion. This project 
called growth with resource enhancement of Environment and nature (GREEN INDIA -2047)” 
has vigorously estimated the reduction in India’s key n atural resources during the period 1947 - 
97, and has completed economic values of consequent loses, which in some cases are alarmingly 
high. On the basis of past experience and a careful analysis of the cost behind the degradation 
that has taken place in t he past strategies for the future have been developed,  Where by a fresh 
and creative approach can be taken in the next 50 years.  
The global presence and reach attained by TERI are not only substantiated by its presence in 
different parts of the world, but also in terms of wide geographical relevance of its activities. 
Symbolic of this fact is the annual Delhi Sustainable Development Summit (DSDS), a major 
event focusing on sustainable
